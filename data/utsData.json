    "Expertise": "Brian Oliver is a NH&MRC career development fellow, who leads a productive team of researchers investigating the pathophysiology of respiratory diseases, with a particular emphasis on understanding basic mechanisms leading to disease exacerbations and progression.;My research can be divided into two main areas;Respiratory infectious diseases;I am interested in understanding why respiratory infections can lead to the development of lung diseases, and also why the same infections can cause an acute increase in symptoms of preexisiting lung diseases.;These are examples of my research in this area.;My team were the first to demonstrate that primary human lung cells from people with asthma have an increased inflammatory response to rhinovirus infection (Resp Res 2006). This increased response is virus specific, and related to differential transcription factor recruitment to inflammatory gene promoters. Since rhinovirus-induced inflammation correlates with both the occurrence and severity of asthma exacerbations this finding helps to explain why exacerbations occur.;We discovered important cellular mechanisms which increase the risk of post-viral secondary infections (Thorax 2008). Specifically we found that virus-infected alveolar macrophages have both a marked inability to release bacterial-induced proinflammatory cytokines and impaired bacterial phagocytosis.;In a local collaboration, we were the first group in the world to show that exhaled breath contains viable respiratory viruses (CID 2008 && JMV 2009);a finding that has now been confirmed by other groups. This important finding is beginning to change the paradigms surrounding respiratory viral transmission.;My group have recently developed an in-vitro model of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations (AJRCMB 2010) which is providing new insight into why β2-agonists, commonly used asthma medications, may be ineffective during exacerbations. Using this model we have recently discovered the cause of β2-adronergic desensitisation (PLoS One 2012).;We have been investigating the potential reasons why viral infections may promote the development of asthma. In asthma the airways are fibrotic, but the reason for this is not known. We hypothesised that fibrosis may occur as a consequence of virus infection. My group has recently published our findings that primary airway cells from people with asthma produce a different panel of rhinovirus-induced ECM proteins in comparison to cells from people without asthma. Kuo C, et al Oliver BG. Rhinovirus infection induces extracellular matrix protein deposition in asthmatic and non-asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells A J Physiology – LCMP (2011) 300 L951-L957;Respiratory Pathogenesis;My undergraduate degree in Human Biology sparked an interest which has now become one of my research foci. I am intrigued why respiratory diseases develop, and why therapeutics often are not as effective as we would hope.;The following are examples of my research in this area;We have been investigating the β2-adronergic pathway, and its regulation, in airway smooth muscle cells from people with asthma, compared to people without asthma. we discovered that a key enzyme which regulates this pathway (PDE4) is overexpressed in asthma, functionally impairing the β2-adronergic pathway (Trian T, ….. and Oliver BG. PLoS ONE 6(5): e20000 2011 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020000). I have also discovered that, contrary to observations in other species, PDE4 is not upregulated by β2-agonists, and therefore is not involved in β2-agonist-induced β2- adronergic tachiphylaxis (Niimi K, ….and Oliver BG). Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 302:L334-L342 2012).;We found that cigarette smoke, the major cause of COPD in developed countries, is a profibrotic stimulus to fibroblasts from only people with COPD. The reason why fibroblasts only from people with COPD respond is intriguing and raises many questions regarding the pathogenesis of COPD. 1. Krimmer DI, et al, Oliver BG. Matrix proteins from smoke exposed fibroblasts are proproliferative Am J Respir Cell (2012) 46 1 34-39.;We have been investigating the aeitology of fibrosis in asthma, and have discovered that tumstatin, an endogenous regulator of angiogenesis, is missing from the airways of people with asthma. We tested the affect of addition of tumstatin using a chronic animal model of asthma, and found that airways hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and angiogenesis were inhibited - demonstrating the complex interaction between the matrix and lung pathophysiology. Burgess, J. K., el al, Oliver, BG. Reduction of tumstatin in asthmatic airways contributes to angiogenesis, inflammation, and hyperresponsiveness Am J Respir Crit Care Med (2010);There is increasing evidence that inflammation and fibrosis develop concurrently, but along independent pathways in lung diseases such as asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. To explore this in-vitro we examined the effect of simulating primary human lung epithelial, smooth muscle and fibroblasts with the pro-inflammatory leukotrienes and the anti-inflammatory prostaglandins. We found the ECM deposition was induced by only prostaglandins supporting the notion that inflammation is not the driving force behind lung fibrosis. Van Ly D, et al, Oliver BG Prostaglandins but not leukotrienes alter extracellular matrix protein deposition & cytokine release in primary human airway smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol (2012) 303 L239-L250;My group was the first to show that primary human lung mesenchymal cells are capable of incorporating exogenously produced soluble extracellular matrix proteins into the deposited extracellular matrix around the cells. This highlights the complexity of ECM deposition in-vivo, and the need to study multiple cell type in-vitro to understand how the ECM is formed in-vivo.

Cellular studies in airway smooth muscle (ASM) have shown that inflammatory mediators and infectious stimuli reduce?2-adrenergic responsiveness in a cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2-mediated, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-dependant manner. Herein, we show that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid that plays an important role in pathophysiology of asthma, also induces?2-adrenergic receptor desensitization in bronchial ASM cells and exerts hyporesponsiveness to?2-agonists. We treated ASM cells with S1P (1?M) for up to 24 hours and then examined the temporal kinetics of COX-2 mRNA expression, protein up-regulation, and PGE2 secretion. S1P significantly enhanced COX-2 expression and PGE2 secretion, and this was repressed by the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, the corticosteroid dexamethasone, or small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of COX-2 expression. In combination with another proinflammatory mediator found elevated in asthmatic airways, the cytokine TNF-?, we observed that S1P-induced COX-2 mRNA expression and protein up-regulation and PGE2 secretion from ASM cells were significantly enhanced. Notably, S1P induced heterologous?2-adrenergic desensitization, as measured by inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate production in response to the short-acting?2-agonist, salbutamol, and the long-acting?2-agonist, formoterol. Taken together, these data indicate that S1P represses?2-adrenergic activity in ASM cells by increasing COX-2-mediated PGE2 production, and suggest that this bioactive sphingolipid found elevated in asthma may contribute to?2-adrenergic desensitization.;Stelzer-Braid, S., Tovey, E.R., Willenborg, C.M., Toelle, B.G., Ampon, R., Garden, F.L., Oliver, B.G., Strachan, R., Belessis, Y., Jaffe, A., Reddel, H.K., Crisafulli, D., Marks, G.B. & Rawlinson, W.D. 2016, 'Absence of back to school peaks in human rhinovirus detections and respiratory symptoms in a cohort of children with asthma', Journal of Medical Virology, vol. 88, no. 4, pp. 578-587.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Much of what is known about the seasonality of human rhinovirus (hRV) infections has been learned from the study of acute asthma exacerbations presenting to emergency care, including those among children at the start of the school term. Much less is known about the patterns of hRVs in the community. In this study, viruses and day-to-day symptoms of asthma and colds were monitored twice weekly in 67 children with asthma aged 5-12 years, over a 15 month period in Sydney, Australia. Overall hRV was detected in 314/1232 (25.5%) of nasal wash samples and 142/1231 (11.5%) of exhaled breath samples, of these, 231 and 24 respectively were genotyped. HRVs were detected with similar prevalence rate throughout the year, including no peak in hRV prevalence following return to school. No peaks were seen in asthma and cold symptoms using twice-weekly diary records. However, over the same period in the community, there were peaks in asthma emergency visits both at a large local hospital and in state-wide hospitalizations, following both return to school (February) and in late autumn (May) in children of the same age. This study suggests that hRV infections are common throughout the year among children, and differences in virus prevalence alone may not account for peaks in asthma symptoms.;Tang, F.S., Van Ly, D., Spann, K., Reading, P.C., Burgess, J.K., Hartl, D., Baines, K.J. & Oliver, B.G. 2016, 'Differential neutrophil activation in viral infections: Enhanced TLR-7/8-mediated CXCL8 release in asthma.', Respirology, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 172-179.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of asthma exacerbations. Neutrophils accumulate in the airways and the mechanisms that link neutrophilic inflammation, viral infections and exacerbations are unclear. This study aims to investigate anti-viral responses in neutrophils from patients with and without asthma and to investigate if neutrophils can be directly activated by respiratory viruses. METHODS: Neutrophils from peripheral blood from asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals were isolated and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1??g/mL), f-met-leu-phe (fMLP) (100?nM), imiquimod (3??g/mL), R848 (1.5??g/mL), poly I:C (10??g/mL), RV16 (multiplicity of infection (MOI)1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (MOI1) or influenza virus (MOI1). Cell-free supernatants were collected after 1?h of neutrophil elastase (NE) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 release, or after 24?h for CXCL8 release. RESULTS: LPS, fMLP, imiquimod and R848 stimulated the release of CXCL8, NE and MMP-9 whereas poly I:C selectively induced CXCL8 release only. R848-induced CXCL8 release was enhanced in neutrophils from asthmatics compared with non-asthmatic cells (P??0.01). RSV triggered the release of CXCL8 and NE from neutrophils, whereas RV16 or influenza had no effect. CONCLUSION: Neutrophils release CXCL8, NE and MMP-9 in response to viral surrogates with R848-induced CXCL8 release being specifically enhanced in asthmatic neutrophils. Toll-like receptor (TLR7/8) dysregulation may play a role in neutrophilic inflammation in viral-induced exacerbations.;Rumzhum, N.N., Patel, B.S., Prabhala, P., Gelissen, I.C., Oliver, B.G. & Ammit, A.J. 2016, 'IL-17A increases TNF-?-induced COX-2 protein stability and augments PGE2 secretion from airway smooth muscle cells: impact on?2 -adrenergic receptor desensitization.', Allergy, vol. 71, no. 3, pp. 387-396.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;BACKGROUND: IL-17A plays an important role in respiratory disease and is a known regulator of pulmonary inflammation and immunity. Recent studies have linked IL-17A with exacerbation in asthma and COPD. We have shown that the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its prostanoid products, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in particular, are key contributors in in vitro models of infectious exacerbation, however, the impact of IL-17A was not known. METHODS AND RESULTS: We address this herein and show that IL-17A induces a robust and sustained upregulation of COX-2 protein and PGE2 secretion from airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. COX-2 can be regulated at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and/or post-translational levels. We have elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the sustained upregulation of TNF-?-induced COX-2 by IL-17A in ASM cells and show that is not via increased COX-2 gene expression. Instead, TNF-?-induced COX-2 upregulation is subject to regulation by the proteasome, and IL-17A acts to increase TNF-?-induced COX-2 protein stability as confirmed by cycloheximide chase experiments. In this way, IL-17A acts to amplify the COX-2-mediated effects of TNF-? and greatly enhances PGE2 secretion from ASM cells. CONCLUSION: As PGE2 is a multifunctional prostanoid with diverse roles in respiratory disease, our studies demonstrate a novel function for IL-17A in airway inflammation by showing for the first time that IL-17A impacts on the COX-2/PGE2 pathway, molecules known to contribute to disease exacerbation.;Patel, B.S., Prabhala, P., Oliver, B.G. & Ammit, A.J. 2015, 'Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4, but not phosphodiesterase 3, increase?2-agonist-induced expression of antiinflammatory mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 in airway smooth muscle cells', American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology, vol. 52, no. 5, pp. 634-640.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Copyright &&copy;2015 by the American Thoracic Society.?inf2/inf-agonists are principally used in asthma to provide bronchodilation, however, they also have antiinflammatory properties, due, in part, to their ability to up-regulate mitogenactivated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP) 1 in a cAMP-dependent manner. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are attractive targets for potentiating the antiinflammatory response. There are 11 subfamilies of PDE enzymes, among these, inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 are the main targets for airway smooth muscle (ASM). PDE enzymes are important intracellular regulators that catalyze the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and/or 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate to their inactive forms. Given that MKP-1 is cAMP dependent, and inhibition of PDE acts to increase?inf2/inf-agonist-induced cAMP, it is possible that the presence of PDE inhibitors may enhance?inf2/inf-adrenoceptor-mediated responses. We address this herein by comparing the ability of a panel of inhibitors against PDE3 (cilostamide, cilostazol, milrinone) or PDE4 (cilomilast, piclamilast, rolipram) to increase cAMP, MKP-1 mRNA expression, and protein up-regulation in ASM cells induced in response to the?inf2/inf-agonist formoterol. Our data show that inhibitors of PDE4, but not PDE3, increase?inf2/inf-agonist-induced cAMP and induce MKP-1 mRNA expression and protein up-regulation. When cAMP was increased, there was a concomitant increase in MKP-1 levels and significant inhibition of TNF-?-induced CXCL8 (IL-8). This result was consistent with all PDE4 inhibitors examined but not for the PDE3 inhibitors. These findings reinforce cAMP-dependent control of MKP-1 expression, and suggest that PDE4 is the predominant PDE isoform responsible for formoterolinduced cAMP breakdown in ASM cells. Our study is the first to demonstrate that PDE4 inhibitors augment antiinflammatory effects of?inf2/inf-agonists via increased MKP-1 expression in ASM cells.;Ly, D.V. & Oliver, B.G.G. 2015, 'Do we really need to keep redesigning?2-agonists for the management of asthma?', Current Drug Delivery, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 9-15.;copy;2015 Bentham Science Publishers. There is an enormous drive to refine therapeutic designs and delivery systems, but in this review we ask if this is always the right direction? We choose to play devil's advocate, and argue that refining drug design is not always needed, and what is actually needed is a greater understanding of the biology of the disease. Here we focus on asthma and the?inf2/inf-agonist group of bronchodilators as an example of how a class of therapeutic has been developed and continues to be developmentally refined. In this review, we define viralinduced exacerbations as the greatest cause of lung attacks and the most crucial time?inf2/inf-agonist therapy is needed. We explore the reasons why?inf2/inf-agonist therapy fails in patients with rhinovirus-induced exacerbations, and explain why further 'engineered'?inf2/inf-agonist therapies are likely to continue to fail in this subset of asthmatic population. We justify our perspective by returning to the biology that underlies the cause of disease and highlight the need for 'more research' into alternative therapies for this population of asthmatic patients.;Tovey, E.R., Stelzer-Braid, S., Toelle, B.G., Oliver, B.G., Reddel, H.K., Willenborg, C.M., Belessis, Y., Garden, F.L., Jaffe, A., Strachan, R., Eyles, D., Rawlinson, W.D. & Marks, G.B. 2015, 'Rhinoviruses significantly affect day-to-day respiratory symptoms of children with asthma', Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, vol. 135, no. 3, pp. 663-669.e12.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Background Viruses are frequently associated with acute exacerbations of asthma, but the extent to which they contribute to the level of day-to-day symptom control is less clear. Objective We sought to explore the relationship between viral infections, host and environmental factors, and respiratory symptoms in children. Methods Sixty-seven asthmatic children collected samples twice weekly for an average of 10 weeks. These included nasal wash fluid and exhaled breath for PCR-based detection of viral RNA, lung function measurements, and records of medication use and asthma and respiratory symptoms in the previous 3 days. Atopy, mite allergen exposure, and vitamin D levels were also measured. Mixed-model regression analyses were performed. Results Human rhinoviruses (hRVs) were detected in 25.5% of 1232 nasal samples and 11.5% of breath samples. Non-hRV viruses were detected in less than 3% of samples. hRV in nasal samples was associated with asthma symptoms (cough and phlegm: odds ratio = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4-2.86, P =.0001, wheeze and chest tightness: odds ratio = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.55-3.52, P.0001) and with cold symptoms, as reported concurrently with sampling and 3 to 4 days later. No differences were found between the 3 hRV genotypes (hRV-A, hRV-B, and hRV-C) in symptom risk. A history of inhaled corticosteroid use, but not atopic status, mite allergen exposure, or vitamin D levels, modified the association between viruses and asthma symptoms. Conclusion The detection of nasal hRV was associated with a significantly increased risk of day-to-day asthma symptoms in children. Host, virus genotype, and environmental factors each had only a small or no effect on the relationship of viral infections to asthma symptoms.;Ge, Q., Chen, L., Jaffar, J., Argraves, W.S., Twal, W.O., Hansbro, P., Black, J.L., Burgess, J.K. & Oliver, B. 2015, 'Fibulin 1C peptide induces cell attachment and extracellular matrix deposition in lung fibroblasts', Scientific Reports, vol. 5.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Fibulin-1 is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, levels of which are elevated in serum and lung tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared to healthy volunteers. Inhibition of fibulin-1C, one of four fibulin-1 isoforms, reduced proliferation and wound healing in human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. This study identified the bioactive region/s of fibulin-1C which promotes fibrosis. Seven fibulin-1C peptides were synthesized and used to pre-coat tissue culture plates before lung derived ASM cells and fibroblasts from patients with pulmonary fibrosis (PF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or neither disease (Control) were plated. Peptide effects on in vitro measures of fibrosis: cell attachment, proliferation and viability, and ECM deposition, were examined. Among these peptides, peptide 1C1 (FBLN1C1) enhanced ASM cell and fibroblast attachment. FBLN1C1 increased mitochondrial activity and proliferation in fibroblasts. In addition, FBLN1C1 stimulated fibulin1 deposition in PF and COPD fibroblasts, and augmented fibronectin and perlecan deposition in all three groups. Peptides FBLN1C2 to FBLN1C7 had no activity. The active fibulin-1C peptide identified in this study describes a useful tool for future studies. Ongoing investigation of the role of fibulin-1 may reveal the mechanisms underlying the pathphysiology of chronic lung diseases.;Haghi, M., Traini, D., Wood, L.G., Oliver, B., Young, P.M. & Chrzanowski, W. 2015, 'A 'soft spot' for drug transport: Modulation of cell stiffness using fatty acids and its impact on drug transport in lung model', Journal of Materials Chemistry B, vol. 3, no. 13, pp. 2583-2589.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015. The impact of a polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid (AA), on membrane fluidity of epithelial cells and subsequent modulation of the drug transport was investigated. Membrane fluidity was assessed using molecular force microscopy. Calu-3 human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured on Transwell&&reg;inserts and the cell stiffness was assessed in the absence of fatty acids or in the presence of 30?M AA. The morphology of the epithelial cells was distinctly different when AA was present, with the cell monolayer becoming more uniform. Furthermore the cell stiffness and variation in stiffness was lower in the presence of AA. In the fat-free medium, the median cell stiffness was 9.1 kPa which dropped to 2.1 kPa following exposure to AA. To further study this, transport of a common?2-agonist, salbutamol sulphate (SS) was measured in the presence of AA and in a fat free medium. The transport of SS was significantly higher when AA was present (0.61 &&plusmn;0.09?g versus 0.11 &&plusmn;0.003?g with and without AA respectively). It was evidenced that AA play a vital role in cell membrane fluidity and drug transport. This finding highlights the significance of the dietary fatty acids in transport and consequentially effectiveness of medications used to treat pulmonary diseases such as asthma.

The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in transport and effectiveness of salbutamol sulfate (SAL) and budesonide (BD) following stimulation with transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) in mono- and coculture models of bronchial and alveolar epithelium. Primary bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, grown at air interface on filters, either as monocultures or in coculture with airway smooth muscle cells or alveolar macrophages, respectively, were stimulated with TGF-?. The biological response was modulated by depositing aerosolized SAL and BD on bronchial and alveolar models, respectively. Barrier integrity, permeability to fluorescein-Na, transport of the deposited drug, and the pharmacological response to SAL (cAMP and IL-8 levels) or BD (IL-6 and -8 levels) were measured. While stimulation with TGF-? did not have any significant effect on the transepithelial electrical resistance and permeability to fluorescein-Na in mono- and coculture models, transport of SAL and BD were affected in cultures from some of the patients (6 out of 12 for bronchial and 2 out of 4 for alveolar cells). The bronchial coculture showed a better responsiveness to SAL in terms of cAMP release than the monoculture. In contrast, the difference between alveolar mono- and cocultures to TGF-? mediated interleukin release and its modulation by BD was less pronounced. Our data point to intrinsic differences in the transport of, and responsiveness to, SAL and BD when epithelial cell cultures originate from different patients. Moreover, if the biological responses (e.g., IL-8, cAMP) involve communication between different cell types, coculture models are more relevant to measure such effects than monocultures.;Chan, Y.L., Saad, S., Simar, D., Oliver, B., McGrath, K., Reyk, D.V., Bertrand, P.P., Gorrie, C., Pollock, C. & Chen, H. 2015, 'Short term exendin-4 treatment reduces markers of metabolic disorders in female offspring of obese rat dams', International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience, vol. 46, pp. 67-75.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 Elsevier Ltd. Objectives: Maternal obesity imposes significant health risks in the offspring including diabetes and dyslipidemia. We previously showed that the hypoglycaemic agent exendin-4 (Ex-4) administered from weaning can reverse the maternal impact of 'transmitted disorders' in such offspring. However daily injection for six-weeks was required and the beneficial effect may lapse upon drug withdrawal. This study aimed to investigate whether short term Ex-4 treatment during suckling period in a rodent model can reverse transmitted metabolic disorders due to maternal obesity. Methods: Maternal obesity was induced in female Sprague Dawley rats by high-fat diet feeding for 6 weeks, throughout gestation and lactation. Female offspring were treated with Ex-4 (5.?g/kg/day) between postnatal day (P) 4 and 14. Female offspring were harvested at weaning (P20). Lipid and glucose metabolic markers were measured in the liver and fat. Appetite regulators were measured in the plasma and hypothalamus. Results: Maternal obesity significantly increased body weight, fat mass, and liver weight in the offspring. There was an associated inhibition of peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1? (PGC1?), increased fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression in the liver, and reduced adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL) expression. It also increased the plasma gut hormone ghrelin and reduced glucagon-like peptide-1. Ex-4 treatment partially reversed the maternal impact on adiposity and impaired lipid metabolism in the offspring, with increased liver PGC1? and inhibition of FASN mRNA expression. Ex-4 treatment also increased the expression of a novel fat depletion gene a2-zinc-glycoprotein 1 in the fat tissue. Conclusion: Short term Ex-4 treatment during the suckling period significantly improved the metabolic profile in the offspring from the obese mothers at weaning. Long-term studies are needed to follow such offspring to adulthood to examine the sustained e...;Herbert, C., Sebesfi, M., Zeng, Q.X., Oliver, B.G., Foster, P.S. & Kumar, R.K. 2015, 'Using multiple online databases to help identify microRNAs regulating the airway epithelial cell response to a virus-like stimulus', Respirology, vol. 20, no. 8, pp. 1206-1212.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology. Background and objective Exacerbations of allergic asthma are often triggered by respiratory viral infections. We have previously shown that in a T-helper type 2 (Th2)-biased cytokine environment, mouse and human airway epithelial cells (AEC) exhibit increased expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral genes in response to synthetic double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), a virus-like stimulus. This implies coordinated regulation of gene expression, suggesting possible involvement of microRNA. To investigate this, we developed a novel approach to identifying candidate microRNA using online databases, then confirmed their expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Methods Using a list of genes of interest, defined on the basis of the previous study as being up-regulated in a Th2 environment, we searched mouse and human microRNA databases for possible regulatory microRNA, and selected 10 candidates that were conserved across species or predicted by more than one human database. Expression of these microRNA was tested by qRT-PCR, in primary human AEC pre-treated with Th2 cytokines and exposed to dsRNA. Results Expression of hsa-miR-139-5p, miR-423-5p and miR-542-3p was significantly decreased in Th2 pre-treated AEC, and miR-135a-5p exhibited a trend towards decreased expression. Further database searches confirmed that these microRNA regulated additional pro-inflammatory and anti-viral response genes for which expression had previously been shown to be up-regulated, confirming the validity of this approach. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the value of using multiple online databases to identify candidate regulatory microRNA and provides the first evidence that in an allergic environment, microRNA may be important in altering the pro-inflammatory and anti-viral responses of human AEC during exacerbations of asthma. The potential role of microRNA in regulating the pro-inflammatory and...;Ng, H.Y., Oliver, B.G.G., Burgess, J.K., Krymskaya, V.P., Black, J.L. & Moir, L.M. 2015, 'Doxycycline reduces the migration of tuberous sclerosis complex-2 null cells - effects on RhoA-GTPase and focal adhesion kinase', Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, vol. 19, no. 11, pp. 2633-2646.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Sons Ltd and Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is associated with dysfunction of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) leading to enhanced cell proliferation and migration. This study aims to examine whether doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, can inhibit the enhanced migration of TSC2-deficient cells, identify signalling pathways through which doxycycline works and to assess the effectiveness of combining doxycycline with rapamycin (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor) in controlling cell migration, proliferation and wound closure. TSC2-positive and TSC2-negative mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), 323-TSC2-positive and 323-TSC2-null MEF and Eker rat uterine leiomyoma (ELT3) cells were treated with doxycycline or rapamycin alone, or in combination. Migration, wound closure and proliferation were assessed using a transwell migration assay, time-lapse microscopy and manual cell counts respectively. RhoA-GTPase activity, phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in TSC2-negative MEF treated with doxycycline were examined using ELISA and immunoblotting techniques. The enhanced migration of TSC2-null cells was reduced by doxycycline at concentrations as low as 20 pM, while the rate of wound closure was reduced at 2-59?M. Doxycycline decreased RhoA-GTPase activity and phosphorylation of FAK in these cells but had no effect on the phosphorylation of p70S6K, ERK1/2 or AKT. Combining doxycycline with rapamycin significantly reduced the rate of wound closure at lower concentrations than achieved with either drug alone. This study shows that doxycycline inhibits TSC2-null cell migration. Thus doxycycline has potential as an anti-migratory agent in the treatment of diseases with TSC2 dysfunction. &&copy;2015 John Wiley;Ge, Q., Zeng, Q., Tjin, G., Lau, E., Black, J.L., Oliver, B.G.G. & Burgess, J.K. 2015, 'Differential deposition of fibronectin by asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells', American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology, vol. 309, no. 10, pp. L1093-L1102.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 the American Physiological Society. Altered ECM protein deposition is a feature in asthmatic airways. Fibronectin (Fn), an ECM protein produced by human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), is increased in asthmatic airways. This study investigated the regulation of Fn production in asthmatic or nonasthmatic HBECs and whether Fn modulated HBEC proliferation and inflammatory mediator secretion. The signaling pathways underlying transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1-regulated Fn production were examined using specific inhibitors for ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, and activin-like kinase 5 (ALK5). Asthmatic HBECs deposited higher levels of Fn in the ECM than nonasthmatic cells under basal conditions, whereas cells from the two groups had similar levels of Fn mRNA and soluble Fn. TGF-?1 increased mRNA levels and ECM and soluble forms of Fn but decreased cell proliferation in both cells. The rate of increase in Fn mRNA was higher in nonasthmatic cells. However, the excessive amounts of ECM Fn deposited by asthmatic cells after TGF-?1 stimulation persisted compared with nonasthmatic cells. Inhibition of ALK5 completely prevented TGF-?1-induced Fn deposition. Importantly, ECM Fn increased HBEC proliferation and IL-6 release, decreased PGE2 secretion, but had no effect on VEGF release. Soluble Fn had no effect on cell proliferation and inflammatory mediator release. Asthmatic HBECs are intrinsically primed to produce more ECM Fn, which when deposited into the ECM, is capable of driving remodeling and inflammation. The increased airway Fn may be one of the key driving factors in the persistence of asthma and represents a novel, therapeutic target.;Tang, F.S.M., Foxley, G.J., Gibson, P.G., Burgess, J.K., Baines, K.J. & Oliver, B.G. 2015, 'Altered Innate Immune Responses in Neutrophils from Patients with Well- and Suboptimally Controlled Asthma', Mediators of Inflammation, vol. 2015.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 Francesca S. M. Tang et al. Background. Respiratory infections are a major cause of asthma exacerbations where neutrophilic inflammation dominates and is associated with steroid refractory asthma. Structural airway cells in asthma differ from nonasthmatics, however it is unknown if neutrophils differ. We investigated neutrophil immune responses in patients who have good (AGood) and suboptimal (ASubopt) asthma symptom control. Methods. Peripheral blood neutrophils from AGood (ACQ 0.75, n=11), ASubopt (ACQ 0.75, n=7), and healthy controls (HC) (n=9) were stimulated with bacterial (LPS (1 g/mL), fMLF (100 nM)), and viral (imiquimod (3 g/mL), R848 (1.5 g/mL), and poly I:C (10 g/mL)) surrogates or live rhinovirus (RV) 16 (MOI1). Cell-free supernatant was collected after 1 h for neutrophil elastase (NE) and matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 9 measurements or after 24 h for CXCL8 release. Results. Constitutive NE was enhanced in AGood neutrophils compared to HC. fMLF stimulated neutrophils from ASubopt but not AGood produced 50% of HC levels. fMLF induced MMP-9 was impaired in ASubopt and AGood compared to HC. fMLF stimulated CXCL8 but not MMP-9 was positively correlated with FEV1 and FEV1/FVC. ASubopt and AGood responded similarly to other stimuli. Conclusions. Circulating neutrophils are different in asthma, however, this is likely to be related to airflow limitation rather than asthma control.;Patel, B.S., Rahman, M.M., Rumzhum, N.N., Oliver, B.G., Verrills, N.M. & Ammit, A.J. 2015, 'Theophylline Represses IL-8 Secretion From ASM Cells Independently of PDE Inhibition: Novel Role as a PP2A Activator.', Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Theophylline is an old drug experiencing a renaissance due to its beneficial anti-inflammatory effects in chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and COPD. Multiple modes of anti-inflammatory action have been reported, including inhibition of the enzymes that degrade cAMP - phosphodiesterase (PDE). Utilizing primary cultures of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, we recently revealed that PDE4 inhibitors can potentiate the anti-inflammatory action of?2-agonists by augmenting cAMP-dependent expression of the phosphatase that deactivates MAPK - MKP-1. Therefore the aim of this study was to address whether theophylline repressed cytokine production in a similar, PDE-dependent, MKP-1-mediated manner. Notably, theophylline did not potentiate cAMP release from ASM cells treated with the long-acting?2-agonist formoterol. Moreover, theophylline (0.1-10 &&micro;M) did not increase formoterol-induced MKP-1 mRNA expression nor protein upregulation, consistent with the lack of cAMP generation. However, theophylline (at 10 &&micro;M) was anti-inflammatory and repressed secretion of the neutrophil chemoattractant cytokine, IL-8, produced in response to tumor necrosis factor? (TNF?). Because theophylline's effects were independent of PDE4 inhibition or anti-inflammatory MKP-1, we then wished to elucidate novel mechanisms responsible. We investigated the impact of theophylline on protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a master controller of multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, and show that theophylline increases TNF?-induced PP2A activity in ASM cells. Confirmatory results were obtained in A549 lung epithelial cells. PP2A activators have beneficial effects in ex vivo and in vivo models of respiratory disease. Thus, our study is the first to link theophylline with PP2A activation as a novel mechanism to control respiratory inflammation.;Grafton, K.T., Moir, L.M., Black, J.L., Hansbro, N.G., Hansbro, P.M., Burgess, J.K. & Oliver, B.G. 2014, 'LF-15 & T7, synthetic peptides derived from tumstatin, attenuate aspects of airway remodelling in a murine model of chronic OVA-induced allergic airway disease', PLoS ONE, vol. 9, no. 1.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: Tumstatin is a segment of the collagen-IV protein that is markedly reduced in the airways of asthmatics. Tumstatin can play an important role in the development of airway remodelling associated with asthma due to its antiangiogenic properties. This study assessed the anti-angiogenic properties of smaller peptides derived from tumstatin, which contain the interface tumstatin uses to interact with the aVb3 integrin. Methods: Primary human lung endothelial cells were exposed to the LF-15, T3 and T7 tumstatin-derived peptides and assessed for cell viability and tube formation in vitro. The impact of the anti-angiogenic properties on airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was then examined using a murine model of chronic OVA-induced allergic airways disease. Results: The LF-15 and T7 peptides significantly reduced endothelial cell viability and attenuated tube formation in vitro. Mice exposed to OVA+ LF-15 or OVA+T7 also had reduced total lung vascularity and AHR was attenuated compared to mice exposed to OVA alone. T3 peptides reduced cell viability but had no effect on any other parameters. Conclusion: The LF-15 and T7 peptides may be appropriate candidates for use as novel pharmacotherapies due to their small size and anti-angiogenic properties observed in vitro and in vivo. &&copy;2014 Grafton et al.;Jaffar, J., Unger, S., Corte, T.J., Keller, M., Wolters, P.J., Richeldi, L., Cerri, S., Prêle, C.M., Hansbro, P.M., Argraves, W.S., Oliver, R.A., Oliver, B.G., Black, J.L. & Burgess, J.K. 2014, 'Fibulin-1 predicts disease progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', Chest, vol. 146, no. 4, pp. 1055-1063.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2014 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CHEST PHYSICIANS. BACKGROUND: The underlying mechanisms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are unknown. This progressive disease has high mortality rates, and current models for prediction of mortality have limited value in identifying which patients will progress. We previously showed that the glycoprotein fibulin-1 is involved in enhanced proliferation and wound repair by mesenchymal cells and, thus, may contribute to lung fibrosis in IPF. METHODS: Serum, lung tissue, and lung function values were obtained from four independent locations (Sydney, NSW, and Perth, WA, Australia, San Francisco, CA, and Modena, Italy). Patients with IPF were followed for a minimum of 1 year and progression was defined as a significant decline in lung function or death. Primary parenchymal lung fibroblasts of 15 patients with and without IPF were cultured under nonstimulatory conditions. Fibulin-1 levels in serum, and secreted or deposited by fibroblasts, were measured by western blot and in lung tissue by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Serum fibulin-1 levels were increased in patients with IPF compared with subjects without lung disease (P 5.006). Furthermore, tissue fi bulin-1 levels were increased in patients with IPF (P 5.02) and correlated negatively with lung function (r 5 2 0.9, P,.05). Primary parenchymal fibroblasts from patients with IPF produced more fibulin-1 than those from subjects without IPF (P,.05). Finally, serum fibulin-1 levels at first blood draw predicted disease progression in IPF within 1 year (area under the curve, 0.71, 95% CI, 0.57-0.86, P 5.012). CONCLUSIONS: Fibulin-1 is a novel potential biomarker for disease progression in IPF and raises the possibility that it could be used as a target for the development of new treatments.;Chen, L., Ge, Q., Tjin, G., Alkhouri, H., Deng, L., Brandsma, C.A., Adcock, I., Timens, W., Postma, D., Burgess, J.K., Black, J.L. & Oliver, B.G.G. 2014, 'Effects of cigarette smoke extract on human airway smooth muscle cells in COPD', European Respiratory Journal, vol. 44, no. 3, pp. 634-646.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;We hypothesised that the response to cigarette smoke in airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells from smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) would be intrinsically different from smokers without COPD, producing greater pro-inflammatory mediators and factors relating to airway remodelling. ASM cells were obtained from smokers with or without COPD, and then stimulated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or transforming growth factor-?1. The production of chemokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were measured by ELISA, and the deposition of collagens by extracellular matrix ELISA. The effects of CSE on cell attachment and wound healing were measured by toluidine blue attachment and cell tracker green wound healing assays. CSE increased the release of CXCL8 and CXCL1 from human ASM cells, and cells from smokers with COPD produced more CSE-induced CXCL1. The production of MMP-1, -3 and -10, and the deposition of collagen VIII alpha 1 (COL8A1) were increased by CSE, especially in the COPD group which had higher production of MMP-1 and deposition of COL8A1. CSE decreased ASM cell attachment and wound healing in the COPD group only. ASM cells from smokers with COPD were more sensitive to CSE stimulation, which may explain, in part, why some smokers develop COPD.

The aim of this work was to identify altered proteins in LAM serum which may be potential biomarkers of disease. Serum from LAM patient volunteers and healthy control volunteers were pooled and analysis carried out using quantitative 4-plex iTRAQ technology. Differentially expressed proteins were validated using ELISAs and pathway analysis was carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Fourteen proteins were differentially expressed in LAM serum compared to control serum (p0.05). Further screening validated the observed differences in extracellular matrix remodelling proteins including fibronectin (30% decrease in LAM, p = 0.03), von Willebrand Factor (40% reduction in LAM, p = 0.03) and Kallikrein III (25% increase in LAM, p = 0.03). Pathway networks elucidated the relationships between the ECM and cell trafficking in LAM. This study was the first to highlight an imbalance in networks important for remodelling in LAM, providing a set of novel potential biomarkers.

Further research is required to understand how infection worsens asthma control in order to advance therapeutic options in the future. Recent research has revealed that?inf2/inf- Adrenergic receptor (?inf2/inf-AR) agonists lose bronchodilatory efficacy because the receptor-mediated molecular pathways responsible for their beneficial actions are desensitized by infection. To date, most studies have focussed on viral infection, leaving the impact of bacterial infection on?inf2/inf-AR desensitization relatively under-investigated. We address this in this study. Methods and Results Utilizing an in vitro model of bacterial exacerbation in airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, we show that activation of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2, mimicking bacterial infection) in the presence of an inflammatory stimulus leads to?inf2/inf-AR desensitization. This occurs via TLR2-dependent upregulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) mRNA expression and increased secretion of PGEinf2/inf. Importantly, PGE inf2/inf causes heterologous?inf2/inf-AR desensitization and reduces cAMP production in response to short-Acting (salbutamol) and long-Acting (formoterol)?inf2/inf-Agonists. Thus, bacterial infectious stimuli act in a PGEinf2/inf-dependent manner to severely curtail the beneficial actions of?inf2/inf-Agonists. The impact of?inf2/inf-AR desensitization is demonstrated by reduced gene expression of the critical anti-inflammatory molecule MKP-1 in response to?inf2/inf-Agonists, as well as impaired bronchodilation in a mouse lung slices. Conclusions Taken together, our results show that, like viruses, bacteria induce prostanoid-dependent?inf2/inf-AR desensitization on ASM cells. Notably, COX-2 inhibition with the specific inhibitor celecoxib represses PGEinf2/inf secretion, presenting a feasible pharmacological option for tr...;Oliver, B.G.G., Robinson, P., Peters, M. & Black, J. 2014, 'Viral infections and asthma: An inflammatory interface?', European Respiratory Journal, vol. 44, no. 6, pp. 1666-1681.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2014 ERS. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways in which the majority of patients respond to treatment with corticosteroids and?inf2/inf-adrenoceptor agonists. Acute exacerbations of asthma substantially contribute to disease morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs, and are not restricted to patients who are not compliant with their treatment regimens. Given that respiratory viral infections are the principal cause of asthma exacerbations, this review article will explore the relationship between viral infections and asthma, and will put forward hypotheses as to why virus-induced exacerbations occur. Potential mechanisms that may explain why current therapeutics do not fully inhibit virus-induced exacerbations, for example,?inf2/inf-adrenergic desensitisation and corticosteroid insensitivity, are explored, as well as which aspects of virus-induced inflammation are likely to be attenuated by current therapy.;Herbert, C., Zeng, Q.X., Shanmugasundaram, R., Garthwaite, L., Oliver, B.G. & Kumar, R.K. 2014, 'Response of airway epithelial cells to double-stranded RNA in an allergic environment.', Transl Respir Med, vol. 2, no. 1, p. 11.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;BACKGROUND: Respiratory viral infections are the most common trigger of acute exacerbations in patients with allergic asthma. The anti-viral response of airway epithelial cells (AEC) may be impaired in asthmatics, while cytokines produced by AEC may drive the inflammatory response. We investigated whether AEC cultured in the presence of Th2 cytokines associated with an allergic environment exhibited altered responses to double-stranded RNA, a virus-like stimulus. METHODS: We undertook preliminary studies using the MLE-12 cell line derived from mouse distal respiratory epithelial cells, then confirmed and extended our findings using low-passage human AEC. Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 for 48&&nbsp;hours, then stimulated with poly I:C for 4&&nbsp;hours. Expression of relevant anti-viral response and cytokine genes was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Secretion of cytokine proteins was assessed by immunoassay. RESULTS: Following stimulation with poly I:C, MLE-12 cells pre-treated with Th2 cytokines exhibited significantly higher levels of expression of mRNA for the cytokine genes Cxcl10 and Cxcl11, as well as a trend towards increased expression of Cxcl9 and Il6. Expression of anti-viral response genes was mostly unchanged, although Stat1, Ifit1 and Ifitm3 were significantly increased in Th2 cytokine pre-treated cells. Human AEC pre-treated with IL-4 and IL-13, then stimulated with poly I:C, similarly exhibited significantly higher expression of IL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and CCL5 genes. In parallel, there was significantly increased secretion of CXCL8 and CCL5, as well as a trend towards increased secretion of CXCL10 and IL-6. Again, expression of anti-viral response genes was not decreased. Rather, there was significantly enhanced expression of mRNA for type III interferons, RNA helicases and other interferon-stimulated genes.

This study aimed to investigate if biomass smoke induced extracellular matrix (ECM) protein production from primary human lung fibroblasts in vitro. Primary human lung fibroblasts (n = 5-10) were stimulated in vitro for up to 72 hours with increasing concentrations of biomass smoke extract (BME) or cigarette smoke extract (CSE) prior to being assessed for deposition of ECM proteins, cytokine release, and activation of intracellular signalling molecules. Deposition of the ECM proteins perlecan and fibronectin was upregulated by both CSE (p,0.05) and BME (p,0.05). The release of the neutrophilic chemokine IL-8 was also enhanced by BME. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was significantly upregulated by BME (p,0.05). Chemical inhibition of ERK signalling molecules partially attenuated these effects (p,0.05). Stimulation with endotoxin had no effect. This study demonstrated that BME had similar effects to CSE in vitro and had the capacity to directly induce fibrosis by upregulating production of ECM proteins. The mechanisms by which both biomass and cigarette smoke exposure cause lung damage may be similar.

It includes thickening of the airway wall, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMC), as well as an increased vascularity of the sub-epithelial cell layer BSMC are known to be the effector cells of bronchoconstriction, but they are increasingly recognized as an important source of inflammatory mediators and angiogenic factors. Objective: To compare the angiogenic potential of BSMC of asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients and to identify asthma-specific angiogenic factors Methods: Primary BSMC were isolated from human airway tissue of asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. Conditioned medium (CM) collected from BSMC isolates was tested for angiogenic capacity using the endothelial cell (EC)-spheroid in vitro angiogenesis assay. Angiogenic factors in CM were quantified using a human angiogenesis antibody array and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Induction of sprout outgrowth from EC-spheroids by CM of BSMC obtained from asthma patients was increased compared with CM of control BSMC (twofold, p 0.001). Levels of ENA-78, GRO-? and IL-8 were significantly elevated in CM of BSMC from asthma patients (p 0.05 vs. non-asthmatic patients). SB 265610, a competitive antagonist of chemokine (CXC-motif) receptor 2 CXCR2), attenuated the increased sprout outgrowth induced by CM of asthma patient-derived BSMC. Conclusions: BSMC isolated from asthma patients exhibit increased angiogenic potential. This effect is mediated through the CXCR2 ligands (ENA78, GRO-? and IL-8) produced by BSMC Implications: CXCR2 ligands may play a decisive role in directing the neovascularization in the sub-epithelial cell layers of the lungs of asthma patients Counteracting the CXCR2 mediated neovascularization by pharmaceutical compounds may represent a novel strategy to reduce airway remodelling in asthma. &&copy;2013 Keglowich et al.;Van Ly, D., De Pedro, M., James, P., Morgan, L., Black, J.L., Burgess, J.K. & Oliver, B.G.G. 2013, 'Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 modulates cytokine induction from toll like receptor activated, but not rhinovirus infected, primary human airway smooth muscle', Respiratory Research, vol. 14, no. 1.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: Virus-induced exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are a significant health burden and occur even in those receiving the best current therapies. Rhinovirus (RV) infections are responsible for half of all COPD exacerbations. The mechanism by which exacerbations occur remains undefined, however it is likely to be due to virus-induced inflammation. Given that phophodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors have an anti-inflammatory effect in patients with COPD they present a potential therapy prior to, and during, these exacerbations.Methods: In the present study we investigated whether the PDE4 inhibitor piclamilast (10-6&&nbsp;M) could alter RV or viral mimetic (5&&nbsp;?g/mL of imiquimod or poly I:C) induced inflammation and RV replication in primary human airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) and bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). The mediators IL-6, IL-8, prostaglandin E2 and cAMP production were assayed by ELISA and RV replication was assayed by viral titration.Results: We found that in ASMCs the TLR3 agonist poly I:C induced IL-8 release was reduced while induced IL-6 release by the TLR7/8 agonist imiquimod was further increased by the presence of piclamilast. However, in RV infected ASMCs, virus replication and induced mediator release were unaltered by piclamilast, as was also found in HBECs. The novel findings of this study reveal that although PDE inhibitors may not influence RV-induced cytokine production in ASMCs and replication in either ASMCs or HBECs, they have the capacity to be anti-inflammatory during TLR activation by modulating the induction of these chemotactic cytokines.Conclusion: By extrapolating our in vitro findings to exacerbations of COPD in vivo this suggests that PDE4 inhibitors may have beneficial anti-inflammatory properties when patients are infected with bacteria or viruses other than RV. &&copy;2013 Van Ly et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;Hirota, J.A., Im, H., Rahman, M.M., Rumzhum, N.N., Manetsch, M., Pascoe, C.D., Bunge, K., Alkhouri, H., Oliver, B.G. & Ammit, A.J. 2013, 'The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein-3 inflammasome is not activated in airway smooth muscle upon toll-like receptor-2 ligation', American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology, vol. 49, no. 4, pp. 517-524.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Inflammasomes have emerged as playing key roles in inflammation and innate immunity. A growing body of evidence has suggested that the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasomeisimportant inchronic airwaydiseases suchas asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Inflammasome activation results, in part, in pro-IL-1? processing and the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1?. Because asthma exacerbations are associated with elevated concentrations of secreted IL-1?, we addressed whether the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated under in vitro conditions that mimic infectious exacerbations in asthma. Primary cultures of airway smoothmuscle (ASM) cells were treated with infectious stimuli (mimicked using the Toll-like receptor-2 agonist Pam3CSK4, a synthetic bacterial lipopeptide).Whereas Pam3CSK4 robustlyup-regulatedASMcytokineexpressionin response toTNF-?and significantly enhanced IL-1? mRNA expression, we were unable to detect IL-1? in the cell supernatants. Thus, IL-1? was not secreted and therefore was unable to act in an autocrine manner to promote the amplification of ASMinflammatory responses.Moreover, Toll-like receptor-2 ligation did not enhanceNLRP3 or caspase-1 expression in ASM cells, and NLRP3 and caspase-1 protein were not present in the ASM layer of tracheal sections from human donors. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the enhanced synthetic function of ASM cells, induced by infectious exacerbations of airway inflammation, is NLRP3 inflammasome-independent and IL-1?-independent. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by invading pathogens may prove cell type-specific in exacerbations of airway inflammation in asthma.

Abnormal and exaggerated deposition of ECM proteins is a hallmark of many fibrotic diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) where small airway fibrosis occurs. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of FBLN-1 by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-?1) (a pro-fibrotic stimulus) in primary human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells from volunteers with and without COPD. Human ASM cells were seeded at a density of 1104 cells/cm2, and stimulated with or without TGF-?1 (10 ng/ml) for 72 hours before FBLN-1 deposition and soluble FBLN-1 were measured. Fold change in FBLN-1 mRNA was measured at 4, 8, 24, 48, 72 hours. In some experiments, cycloheximide (0.5?g/ml) was used to assess the regulation of FBLN-1 production. TGF-?1 decreased the amount of soluble FBLN-1 both from COPD and non-COPD ASM cells. In contrast, the deposition of FBLN-1 into the ECM was increased in ASM cells obtained from both groups. TGF-?1 did not increase FBLN-1 gene expression at any of the time points. There were no differences in the TGF-?1 induced FBLN-1 levels between cells from people with or without COPD. Cycloheximide treatment, which inhibits protein synthesis, decreased both the constitutive release of soluble FBLN-1, and TGF-?1 induced ECM FBLN-1 deposition. Furthermore, in cycloheximide treated cells addition of soluble FBLN-1 resulted in incorporation of FBLN-1 into the ECM. Therefore the increased deposition of FBLN-1 by ASM cells into the ECM following treatment with TGF-?1 is likely due to incorporation of soluble FBLN-1 rather than de-novo synthesis. &&copy;2013 Chen et al.;Faiz, A., Tjin, G., Harkness, L., Weckmann, M., Bao, S., Black, J.L., Oliver, B.G.G. & Burgess, J.K. 2013, 'The Expression and Activity of Cathepsins D, H and K in Asthmatic Airways', PLoS ONE, vol. 8, no. 3.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Tumstatin is an anti-angiogenic collagen IV?3 fragment, levels of which are reduced in the airways of asthmatics. Its reduction may be due to the degradation by extracellular matrix (ECM) proteases. Cathepsins play a role in ECM remodelling, with cathepsin D, H and K (CTSD, CTSH and CTSK) being associated with lung diseases. CTSD modulates the NC1 domains of collagen molecules including tumstatin, while CTSH and CTSK are involved in ECM degradation. The role of these cathepsins in the regulation of tumstatin in the lung has not previously been examined. We demonstrated that CTSB, D, F, H, K, L and S mRNA was expressed in the airways. Quantification of immunohistochemistry showed that there is no difference in the global expression of CTSD, CTSH and CTSK between asthmatics and non-asthmatics. CTSD and CTSK, but not CTSH had the capacity to degrade tumstatin. No difference was observed in the activity of CTSD and H in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic and non-asthmatics, while CTSK was undetectable. This indicates that while CTSD possesses the potential to directly regulate tumstatin, and thus angiogenesis through this mechanism however, it is not likely to be involved in the dysregulation of tumstatin found in asthmatic airways. &&copy;2013 Faiz et al.;Van Ly, D., Faiz, A., Jenkins, C., Crossett, B., Black, J.L., McParland, B., Burgess, J.K. & Oliver, B.G.G. 2013, 'Characterising the Mechanism of Airway Smooth Muscle?2 Adrenoceptor Desensitization by Rhinovirus Infected Bronchial Epithelial Cells', PLoS ONE, vol. 8, no. 2.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Rhinovirus (RV) infections account for approximately two thirds of all virus-induced asthma exacerbations and often result in an impaired response to?2 agonist therapy. Using an in vitro model of RV infection, we investigated the mechanisms underlying RV-induced?2 adrenoceptor desensitization in primary human airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC). RV infection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) for 24 hours produced conditioned medium that caused?2 adrenoceptor desensitization on ASMCs without an effect on ASMCs viability. Less than 3 kDa size fractionation together with trypsin digestion of RV-induced conditioned medium did not prevent?2 adrenoceptor desensitization, suggesting it could potentially be mediated by a small peptide or lipid. RV infection of BECs, ASMCs and fibroblasts produced prostaglandins, of which PGE2, PGF2? and PGI2 had the ability to cause?2 adrenoceptor desensitization on ASMCs. RV-induced conditioned medium from HBECs depleted of PGE2 did not prevent ASMC?2 adrenoceptor desensitization, however this medium induced PGE2 from ASMCs, suggesting that autocrine prostaglandin production may be responsible. Using inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin receptor antagonists, we found that?2 adrenoceptor desensitization was mediated through ASMC derived COX-2 induced prostaglandins. Since ASMC prostaglandin production is unlikely to be caused by RV-induced epithelial derived proteins or lipids we next investigated activation of toll-like receptors (TLR) by viral RNA. The combination of TLR agonists poly I:C and imiquimod induced PGE2 and?2 adrenoceptor desensitization on ASMC as did the RNA extracted from RV-induced conditioned medium. Viral RNA but not epithelial RNA caused?2 adrenoceptor desensitization confirming that viral RNA and not endogenous human RNA was responsible. It was deduced that the mechanism by which?2 adrenoceptor desensitization occurs was by pattern recognition receptor activation of COX-2 induced p...;Yeganeh, B., Xia, C., Movassagh, H., Koziol-White, C., Chang, Y., Al-Alwan, L., Bourke, J.E. & Oliver, B.G.G. 2013, 'Emerging mediators of airway smooth muscle dysfunction in asthma', Pulmonary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 105-111.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Phenotypic changes in airway smooth muscle are integral to the pathophysiological changes that constitute asthma - namely inflammation, airway wall remodelling and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the proliferative, secretory and contractile functions of airway smooth muscle are dysfunctional in asthma. These functions can be modulated by various mediators whose levels are altered in asthma, derived from inflammatory cells or produced by airway smooth muscle itself. In this review, we describe the emerging roles of the CXC chemokines (GROs, IP-10), Th17-derived cytokines (IL-17, IL-22) and semaphorins, as well as the influence of viral infection on airway smooth muscle function, with a view to identifying new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in asthma. &&copy;2012.;Im, H., Hirota, J., Rahman, M., Rumzhum, N., Manetsch, M., Pascoe, C., Oliver, B.G. & Ammit, A. 2013, 'The NLRP3 inflammasome is not activated in airway smooth muscle upon TLR2 ligation', European Respiratory Journal, vol. 42, p. 559.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Inflammasomes have emerged as playing key roles in inflammation and innate immunity. A growing body of evidence has suggested that the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is important in chronic airway diseases such as asthma and COPD. Inflammasome activation results, in part, in pro-IL-1 processing and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1. Because asthma exacerbations are associated with elevated levels of secreted IL-1 we addressed whether the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated under in vitro conditions that mimic infectious exacerbation in asthma. Primary cultures of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells were treated with infectious stimuli (mimicked using the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4, a synthetic bacterial lipopeptide). While Pam3CSK4 robustly upregulated ASM cytokine expression in response to TNFa and significantly enhanced IL-1 mRNA expression, we were unable to detect IL-1 in the cell supernatants. Thus, IL-1 was not secreted and therefore unable to act in an autocrine manner to promote amplification of ASM inflammatory responses. Moreover, TLR2 ligation did not enhance NLRP3 mRNA expression in ASM cells, nor was NLRP3 protein detected in the airway smooth muscle layer of tracheal sections from human donors. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that enhanced synthetic function of ASM cells, induced by infectious exacerbation of airway inflammation, is NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1-independent. Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by invading pathogens may prove cell-type specific in exacerbation of airway inflammation in asthma.;Tan, X., Alrashdan, Y.A., Alkhouri, H., Oliver, B.G.G., Armour, C.L. & Hughes, J.M. 2013, 'Airway smooth muscle CXCR3 ligand production: Regulation by JAK-STAT1 and intracellular Ca2+', American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology, vol. 304, no. 11, pp. L790-L802.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;In asthma, airway smooth muscle (ASM) chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) ligand production may attract mast cells or T lymphocytes to the ASM, where they can modulate ASM functions. In ASM cells (ASMCs) from people with or without asthma, we aimed to investigate JAK-STAT1, JNK, and Ca2+ involvement in chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)10 and CXCL11 production stimulated by interferon-?, IL-1?, and TNF-? combined (cytomix). Confluent, growth-arrested ASMC were treated with inhibitors for pan-JAK (pyridone-6), JAK2 (AG-490), JNK (SP-600125), or the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA) pump (thapsigargin), Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA-AM), or vehicle before and during cytomix stimulation for up to 24 h. Signaling protein activation as well as CXCL10/CXCL11 mRNA and protein production were examined using immunoblot analysis, real-time PCR, and ELISA, respectively. Cytomix-induced STAT1 activation was lower and CXCR3 ligand mRNA production was more sensitive to pyridone-6 and AG-490 in asthmatic than nonasthmatic ASMCs, but CXCL10/CXCL11 release was inhibited by the same proportion. Neither agent caused additional inhibition of release when used in combination with the JNK inhibitor SP-600125. Conversely, p65 NF-?B activation was higher in asthmatic than nonasthmatic ASMCs. BAPTA-AM abolished early CXCL10/CXCL11 mRNA production, whereas thapsigargin reduced it in asthmatic cells and inhibited CXCL10/CXCL11 release by both ASMC types. Despite these inhibitory effects, neither Ca2+ agent affected early activation of STAT1, JNK, or p65 NF-?B. In conclusion, intracellular Ca2+ regulated CXCL10/CXCL11 production but not early activation of the signaling molecules involved. In asthma, reduced ASM STAT1-JNK activation, increased NF-?B activation, and altered Ca2+ handling may contribute to rapid CXCR3 ligand production and enhanced inflammatory cell recruitment. &&copy;2013 the American Physiological Society.;Beckett, E.L., Stevens, R.L., Jarnicki, A.G., Kim, R.Y., Hanish, I., Hansbro, N.G., Deane, A., Keely, S., Horvat, J.C., Yang, M., Oliver, B.G., Van Rooijen, N., Inman, M.D., Adachi, R., Soberman, R.J., Hamadi, S., Wark, P.A., Foster, P.S. & Hansbro, P.M. 2013, 'A new short-term mouse model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease identifies a role for mast cell tryptase in pathogenesis', Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, vol. 131, no. 3, pp. 752-762.e7.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Background: Cigarette smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a life-threatening inflammatory disorder of the lung. The development of effective therapies for COPD has been hampered by the lack of an animal model that mimics the human disease in a short timeframe. Objectives: We sought to create an early-onset mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced COPD that develops the hallmark features of the human condition in a short time-frame. We also sought to use this model to better understand pathogenesis and the roles of macrophages and mast cells (MCs) in patients with COPD. Methods: Tightly controlled amounts of cigarette smoke were delivered to the airways of mice, and the development of the pathologic features of COPD was assessed. The roles of macrophages and MC tryptase in pathogenesis were evaluated by using depletion and in vitro studies and MC protease 6-deficient mice. Results: After just 8 weeks of smoke exposure, wild-type mice had chronic inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, airway remodeling, emphysema, and reduced lung function. These characteristic features of COPD were glucocorticoid resistant and did not spontaneously resolve. Systemic effects on skeletal muscle and the heart and increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections also were observed. Macrophages and tryptase-expressing MCs were required for the development of COPD. Recombinant MC tryptase induced proinflammatory responses from cultured macrophages. Conclusion: A short-term mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced COPD was developed in which the characteristic features of the disease were induced more rapidly than in existing models. The model can be used to better understand COPD pathogenesis, and we show a requirement for macrophages and tryptase-expressing MCs. &&copy;2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.;Weckmann, M., Moir, L.M., Heckman, C.A., Black, J.L., Oliver, B.G. & Burgess, J.K. 2012, 'Lamstatin - a novel inhibitor of lymphangiogenesis derived from collagen IV', Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, vol. 16, no. 12, pp. 3062-3073.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The lymphatic system is essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and immunity. Its dysfunction in disease (such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis) can lead to chylous effusions, oedema or dissemination of malignant cells. Collagen IV has six? chains, of which some of the non-collagenous-1 domains have endogenous anti-angiogenic properties, however, little is known about specific endogenous anti-lymphangiogenic characteristics. In this study we sought to investigate the expression levels of collagen IV non-collagenous-1 domains in lung tissue of patients with and without lymphangioleiomyomatosis to explore the hypothesis that a member of the collagen IV family, specifically the non-collagenous domain-1 of?5, which we named lamstatin, has anti-lymphangiogenic properties. Levels of lamstatin detected by immunohistochemistry were decreased in lungs of lymphangioleiomyomatosis patients. We produced recombinant lamstatin in an E.coli expression system and synthesized a 17-amino acid peptide from a theoretically identified, active region (CP17) and tested their effects in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant lamstatin and CP17 inhibited proliferation, migration and cord formation of human microvascular lung lymphatic endothelial cells, in vitro. Furthermore, lamstatin and CP17 decreased complexity and dysplasia of the tumour-associated lymphatic network in a lung adenocarcinoma xenograft mouse model. In this study we identified a novel, direct inhibitor of lymphangiogenesis, derived from collagen IV. This may prove useful for exploring new avenues of treatment for lymphangioleiomyomatosis and metastasis via the lymphatic system in general. &&copy;2012 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine &&copy;2012 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Ge, Q., Moir, L.M., Trian, T., Niimi, K., Poniris, M., Shepherd, P.R., Black, J.L., Oliver, B.G. & Burgess, J.K. 2012, 'The phosphoinositide 3?-kinase p110? modulates contractile protein production and IL-6 release in human airway smooth muscle', Journal of Cellular Physiology, vol. 227, no. 8, pp. 3044-3052.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Transforming growth factor (TGF)?1 increases pro-inflammatory cytokines and contractile protein expression by human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, which could augment airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Phosphoinositide 3? kinase (PI3K) is one of the signaling pathways implicated in TGF?1 stimulation, and may be altered in asthmatic airways. This study compared the expression of PI3K isoforms by ASM cells from donors with asthma (A), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or neither disease (NA), and investigated the role of PI3K isoforms in the production of TGF?1 induced pro-inflammatory cytokine and contractile proteins in ASM cells. A cells expressed higher basal levels of p110? mRNA compared to NA and COPD cells, however COPD cells produced more p110? protein. TGF?1 increased 110? mRNA expression to the same extent in the three groups. Neither the p110? inhibitor IC87114 (1, 10, 30?M), the p110? inhibitor TGX221 (0.1, 1, 10?M) nor the PI3K pan inhibitor LY294002 (3, 10?M) had any effect on basal IL-6, calponin or smooth muscle?-actin (?-SMA) expression. However, TGF?1 increased calponin and?-SMA expression was inhibited by IC87114 and LY294002 in all three groups. IC87114, TGX221, and LY294002 reduced TGF?1 induced IL-6 release in a dose related manner in all groups of ASM cells. PI3K p110? is important for TGF?1 induced production of the contractile proteins calponin and?-SMA and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in ASM cells, and may therefore be relevant as a potential therapeutic target to treat both inflammation and airway remodeling. &&copy;2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;Essilfie, A.T., Simpson, J.L., Dunkley, M.L., Morgan, L.C., Oliver, B.G., Gibson, P.G., Foster, P.S. & Hansbro, P.M. 2012, 'Combined Haemophilus influenzae respiratory infection and allergic airways disease drives chronic infection and features of neutrophilic asthma', Thorax, vol. 67, no. 7, pp. 588-599.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: 20-30% of patients with asthma have neutrophilic airway inflammation and reduced responsiveness to steroid therapy. They often have chronic airway bacterial colonisation and Haemophilus influenzae is one of the most commonly isolated bacteria. The relationship between chronic airway colonisation and the development of steroid-resistant neutrophilic asthma is unclear. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between H influenzae respiratory infection and neutrophilic asthma using mouse models of infection and ovalbumin (OVA)- induced allergic airways disease. Methods: BALB/c mice were intratracheally infected with H influenzae (day 10), intraperitoneally sensitised (day 0) and intranasally challenged (day 12-15) with OVA. Treatment groups were administered dexamethasone intranasally during OVA challenge. Infection, allergic airways disease, steroid sensitivity and immune responses were assessed (days 11, 16 and 21). Results: The combination of H influenzae infection and allergic airways disease resulted in chronic lung infection that was detected on days 11, 16 and 21 (21, 26 and 31 days after infection). Neutrophilic allergic airways disease and T helper 17 cell development were induced, which did not require active infection. Importantly, all features of neutrophilic allergic airways disease were steroid resistant. Toll-like receptor 4 expression and activation of phagocytes was reduced, but most significantly the influx and/or development of phagocytosing neutrophils and macrophages into the airways was inhibited. Conclusions: The combination of infection and allergic airways disease promotes bacterial persistence, leading to the development of a phenotype similar to steroid-resistant neutrophilic asthma and which may result from dysfunction in innate immune cells. This indicates that targeting bacterial infection in steroid-resistant asthma may have therapeutic benefit.;Tan, X., Khalil, N., Tesarik, C., Vanapalli, K., Yaputra, V., Alkhouri, H., Oliver, B.G.G., Armour, C.L. & Margaret Hughes, J. 2012, 'Th1 cytokine-induced syndecan-4 shedding by airway smooth muscle cells is dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinases', American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology, vol. 302, no. 7, pp. L700-L710.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;In asthma, airway smooth muscle (ASM) chemokine secretion can induce mast cell recruitment into the airways. The functions of the mast cell chemoattractant CXCL10, and other chemokines, are regulated by binding to heparan sulphates such as syndecan-4. This study is the first demonstration that airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) from people with and without asthma express and shed syndecan-4 under basal conditions. Syndecan-4 shedding was enhanced by stimulation for 24 h with the Th1 cytokines interleukin-1? (IL-1?) or tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), but not interferon-? (IFN?), nor the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. ASMC stimulation with IL-1?, TNF-?, and IFN? (cytomix) induced the highest level of syndecan-4 shedding. Nonasthmatic and asthmatic ASM cell-associated syndecan-4 protein expression was also increased by TNF-? or cytomix at 4-8 h, with the highest levels detected in cytomix-stimulated asthmatic cells. Cell-associated syndecan- 4 levels were decreased by 24 h, whereas shedding remained elevated at 24 h, consistent with newly synthesized syndecan-4 being shed. Inhibition of ASMC matrix metalloproteinase-2 did not prevent syndecan-4 shedding, whereas inhibition of ERK MAPK activation reduced shedding from cytomix-stimulated ASMC. Although ERK inhibition had no effect on syndecan-4 mRNA levels stimulated by cytomix, it did cause an increase in cell-associated syndecan-4 levels, consistent with the shedding being inhibited. In conclusion, ASMC produce and shed syndecan-4 and although this is increased by the Th1 cytokines, the MAPK ERK only regulates shedding. ASMC syndecan-4 production during Th1 inflammatory conditions may regulate chemokine activity and mast cell recruitment to the ASM in asthma. &&copy;2012 the American Physiological Society.;Baraket, M., Oliver, B.G.G., Burgess, J.K., Lim, S., King, G.G. & Black, J.L. 2012, 'Is low dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy as effective for inflammation and remodeling in asthma? A randomized, parallel group study', Respiratory Research, vol. 13.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: While most of the clinical benefits of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy may occur at low doses, results of dose-ranging studies are inconsistent. Although symptom/lung function response to low and high dose ICS medication is comparable, it is uncertain whether low dose ICSs are as effective as high dose in the treatment of inflammation and remodeling.Methods: 22 mild or moderate asthmatic adult subjects (corticosteroid free for 2 months) participated in a randomized, parallel group study to compare effects of fluticasone propionate (FP) 200 mcg/day and 1000 mcg/day. Alveolar macrophage (AM)-derived cytokines and basement membrane thickness (BMT) were measured at baseline and after 7 weeks treatment while symptoms, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to mannitol at baseline and 6 weeks.Results: FP improved spirometry, eNO, symptoms and AHR with no difference between low and high dose FP. Both high and low dose FP reduced GM-CSF, TNF-alpha and IL-1ra, with no change in BMT and with no differences between low and high dose FP.Conclusions: 200?g/day of FP was as effective as 1000?g/day in improving asthma control, airway inflammation, lung function and AHR in adults in the short term. Future studies should examine potential differential effects between low and high dose combination therapy (ICS/long acting beta agonist) on inflammation and airway remodeling over longer treatment periods. &&copy;2012 Baraket et al, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;Krimmer, D.I., Burgess, J.K., Wooi, T.K., Black, J.L. & Oliver, B.G.G. 2012, 'Matrix proteins from smoke-exposed fibroblasts are pro-proliferative', American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology, vol. 46, no. 1, pp. 34-39.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Airway remodeling decreases lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition is increased in remodeled airways and drives cellular processes of proliferation, migration, and inflammation.

Deposition of perlecan, fibronectin, and elastin were measured by ELISA, as was release of IL-8 and IL-13. Unstimulated fibroblast cells were reseeded onto deposited matrix and assessed for proliferation and cytokine release. CSE (5%) increased deposition of fibronectin and perlecan from only COPD fibroblasts. Fibronectin and perlecan deposition was attenuated by addition of the NF-?B inhibitor, BMS-345541, and the signal transduction and activator of transcription-1/3 inhibitor, pyridone 6, respectively. CSE (5%) increased IL-8 release from COPD fibroblasts more than non-COPD fibroblasts. This increase was attenuated by BMS-345541. Matrix deposited after 5%CSE stimulation increased proliferation of fibroblasts, but did not alter cytokine release. ECM produced from COPD fibroblasts after CSE exposure has proproliferative effects.

This study aimed to investigate functional properties of the different perlecan domains in relation to airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC). Primary human ASMC obtained from donors with asthma (n = 13), COPD (n = 12), or other lung disease (n = 20) were stimulated in vitro with 1 ng/ml transforming growth factor-? 1 (TGF-(31) before perlecan deposition and cytokine release were analyzed. In some experiments, inhibitors of signaling molecules were added. Perlecan domains I-V were seeded on tissue culture plates at 10 (xg/ml with 1 (xg/ml collagen I as a control. ASM was incubated on top of the peptides before being analyzed for attachment, proliferation, and wound healing. TGF-? 1 upregulated deposition of perlecan by ASMC from COPD subjects only. TGF-(31 upregulated release of IL-6 into the supernatant of ASMC from all subjects. Inhibitors of SMAD and JNK signaling molecules decreased TGF-? 1-induced perlecan deposition by COPD ASMC. Attachment of COPD ASMC was upregulated by collagen I and perlecan domains IV and V, while perlecan domain II upregulated attachment only of asthmatic ASMC. Seeding on perlecan domains did not increase proliferation of any ASMC type. TGF-? 1-induced perlecan deposition may enhance attachment of migrating ASMC in vivo and thus may be a mechanism for ASMC layer hypertrophy in COPD. &&copy;2012 the American Physiological Society.;Ge, Q., Moir, L.M., Trian, T., Niimi, K., Poniris, M., Shepherd, P.R., Black, J.L., Oliver, B.G. & Burgess, J.K. 2012, 'The phosphoinositide 3'-kinase p110d modulates contractile protein production and IL-6 release in human airway smooth muscle', Journal of Cellular Physiology, vol. 227, no. 8, pp. 3044-3052.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Transforming growth factor (TGF) 1 increases pro-inflammatory cytokines and contractile protein expression by human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, which could augment airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness.

Primary ASM cells from people with or without asthma were stimulated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-? 1, formoterol, and/or budesonide. PDE4D mRNA was assessed by real-time PCR, or PCR to assess splice variant production. PDE4D protein was assessed by Western blotting, and we investigated the effect of formoterol on cAMP production and PDE activity. Interleukin (IL)-6 was assessed using ELISA. PDE4D mRNA was dose dependently upregulated by formoterol, with a single splice variant, PDE4D5, present. Formoterol did not induce PDE4D protein at time points between 3 to 72 h, whereas it did induce and increase IL-6 secretion. We pretreated cells with actinomycin D and a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and found no evidence of alterations in mRNA, protein expression, or degradation of PDE4D. Finally PDE activity was not altered by formoterol. This study shows, for the first time, that PDE4D5 is predominantly expressed in human ASM cells from people with and without asthma and that formoterol does not upregulate PDE4D protein production. This leads us to speculate that continual therapy with? 2AR agonists is unlikely to cause PDE4-mediated tachyphylaxis. &&copy;2012 the American Physiological Society.;Black, J.L., Burgess, J. & Oliver, B. 2012, 'On the one hand, on the other hand', Journal of Applied Physiology, vol. 113, no. 5, p. 845.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Kuo, C., Lim, S., King, N.J.C., Bartlett, N.W., Walton, R.P., Zhu, J., Glanville, N., Aniscenko, J., Johnston, S.L., Burgess, J.K., Black, J.L. & Oliver, B.G. 2012, 'Erratum: Rhinovirus infection induces expression of airway remodelling factors in vitro and in vivo (Respirology (2011) 16 (367-377))', Respirology, vol. 17, no. 1, p. 192.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Van Ly, D., Burgess, J.K., Brock, T.G., Lee, T.H., Black, J.L. & Oliver, B.G.G. 2012, 'Prostaglandins but not leukotrienes alter extracellular matrix protein deposition and cytokine release in primary human airway smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts', American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology, vol. 303, no. 3, pp. L239-L250.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Eicosanoids are lipid-signaling mediators released by many cells in response to various stimuli.

PGE 2 decreased both fibronectin and tenascin C in fibroblasts but only fibronectin in ASM. PGD 2 decreased both fibronectin and tenascin C in both ASM and fibroblasts, whereas PGF 2? had no effect on ECM deposition.

Neither the acute nor repeated stimulation with leukotrienes had an effect on the deposition of ECM proteins or cytokine release from ASM or fibroblasts. We concluded that, collectively, these results provide evidence that PGs may contribute to ECM remodeling to a greater extent than leukotrienes in airway cells. &&copy;2012 the American Physiological Society.;Bosse, Y., Vagula, M.C., Rawding, R.S., Pun, M., Black, J.L., Burgess, J., Oliver, B., Berger, P., Marthan, R. & Adner, M. 2012, 'Comments on Point:Counterpoint: Alterations in airway smooth muscle phenotype do/do not cause airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma.', Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md.: 1985), vol. 113, no. 5, pp. 844-846.;Borger, P., Oliver, B., Heijink, I. & Hardavella, G. 2012, 'Beyond the Immune System: The Role of Resident Cells in Asthma and COPD', Journal of Allergy, vol. 2012, pp. 1-3.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Trian, T., Burgess, J.K., Niimi, K., Moir, L.M., Ge, Q., Berger, P., Liggett, S.B., Black, J.L. & Oliver, B.G. 2011, '?2-agonist induced cAMP is decreased in asthmatic airway smooth muscle due to increased PDE4D', PLoS ONE, vol. 6, no. 5.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background and Objective: Asthma is associated with airway narrowing in response to bronchoconstricting stimuli and increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass.

Methods: We examined?2-adrenergic (?2AR) receptor expression and basal?-agonist and forskolin (direct activator of adenylyl cyclase) stimulated cAMP production in asthmatic cultured ASM (n = 15) and non-asthmatic ASM (n = 22). Based on these results, PDE activity, PDE4D expression and cell proliferation were determined. Results: In the presence of IBMX, a pan PDE inhibitor, asthmatic ASM had?50% lower cAMP production in response to isoproterenol, albuterol, formoterol, and forskolin compared to non-asthmatic ASM. However when PDE4 was specifically inhibited, cAMP production by the agonists and forskolin was normalized in asthmatic ASM.

Furthermore, inhibition of PDE4 reduced asthmatic ASM proliferation but not that of non-asthmatic ASM. Conclusion: Decreased?-agonist induced cAMP in ASM from asthmatics results from enhanced degradation due to increased PDE4D expression.

The class IA PI3K isoforms are known to be activated by growth factors and cytokines. Because this pathway is a possible site of pharmacological intervention for treating the disease, it is important to know which isoforms contribute to this process. Therefore, we used a pharmacological approach to investigate the roles of the three class IA PI3K isoforms (p110?, p110?, and p110?) in airway remodeling using airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells derived from asthmatic subjects and ASM cells and lung fibroblasts from nonasthmatic subjects. These studies used the inhibitors N'-[(E)-(6-bromoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl) methylidene]- N,2-dimethyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonohydrazide (PIK75) (which selectively inhibits p110?), 7-methyl-2-(4-morpholinyl)-9- [1-(phenylamino)ethyl]-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (TGX221) (which selectively inhibits p110?), and 2-[(6-amino-9H-purin-9- yl)methyl]-5-methyl-3-(2-methylphenyl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone (IC87114) (which selectively inhibits p110?). Cells were stimulated with transforming growth factor-? (TGF?) and/or 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of inhibitor or vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide). PIK75, but not TGX221 or IC87114, attenuated TGF?-induced fibronectin deposition in all cell types tested. PIK75 and TGX221 each decreased secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-6 in nonasthmatic ASM cells and lung fibroblasts, whereas TGX221 was not as effective in asthmatic ASM cells. In addition, PIK75 decreased cell survival in TGF?-stimulated asthmatic, but not nonasthmatic, ASM cells. In conclusion, specific PI3K isoforms may play a role in pathophysiological events relevant to airway wall remodeling.

Viral infections may promote the development of asthma and are the most common causes of asthma exacerbations. We evaluated whether rhinovirus (RV) infection induces airway remodelling, as assessed by ECM deposition. Methods: Primary human bronchial epithelial cells and lung parenchymal fibroblasts were infected with RV-2 or RV-16, or treated with RV-16 RNA, imiquimod (Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist) or polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I: C) (activator of TLR 3, retinoic-acid-inducible protein I and melanoma-differentiated-associated gene 5). Changes in ECM proteins and their transcription were measured by ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, gene expression for ECM proteins was assessed in a mouse model of RV infection. Results: RV infection increased deposition of the ECM protein, perlecan, by human bronchial epithelial cells, and collagen V and matrix-bound vascular endothelial growth factor were increased in both human bronchial epithelial cell and fibroblast cultures. Purified RV-16 RNA, poly I: C and imiquimod induced similar increases in ECM deposition to those observed with RV-infected fibroblasts. However, only poly I: C induced ECM deposition by bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that RV-induced ECM deposition is mediated through TLR. Furthermore, gene expression for fibronectin and collagen I was increased in lung homogenates of mice infected with RV-1b. Conclusions: RV infection and TLR ligands promote ECM deposition in isolated cell systems and RV induces ECM gene expression in vivo, thus demonstrating that RV has the potential to contribute to remodelling of the airways through induction of ECM deposition. Airway remodelling, as indicated by increased extracellular matrix production, was induced by rhinovirus in both in vitro and in vivo models.

The cellular mechanism underlying this pathology is likely the result of RV-induced nuclear-factor-kappa-B-(NF-?B-) dependent inflammation. NF-?B may also be important in RV replication as inhibition of NF-?B inhibits replication of other viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus. To establish the role of NF-?B inhibitors in RV-induced IL- 6 and IL-8 and RV replication, we used pharmacological inhibitors of NF-?B, and steroids and/or?(2) agonists were used for comparison. Primary human lung fibroblasts were infected with RV-16 in the presence of NF-?B inhibitors: BAY-117085 and dimethyl fumarate,?(2) agonist: salmeterol, and/or corticosteroids: dexamethasone, fluticasone. RV-induced IL-6 and IL-8 and RV replication were assessed using ELISAs and virus titration assays. RV replicated and increased IL-6 and IL-8 release. Salmeterol increased, while dexamethasone and fluticasone decreased RV-induced IL-6 and IL-8 (P0.05). The NF-?B inhibitor BAY-117085 inhibited only RV-induced IL-6 (P0.05) and dimethyl fumarate did not alter RV-induced IL-6 and IL-8. Dimethylfumarate increased RV replication whilst other drugs did not alter RV replication.

COPD is projected to be the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020. COPD often results from prolonged exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke or inhaled particulates. Current pharmacotherapies for COPD are unable to reverse the pathological changes of this disease, and this is partially due to a limited understanding of the intricate mechanisms by which chronic exposure lead to the different pathological components of COPD. This review examines how the mechanisms that underlie various components of COPD can be modelled in vitro, specifically using cigarette smoke extract with cells cultured from primary human lung tissue, and how the effectiveness of current and novel pharmacotherapies on successfully attenuating these pathological changes can also be examined in vitro. &&copy;2010 Elsevier Ltd.;Moir, L.M., Ng, H.Y., Poniris, M.H., Santa, T., Burgess, J.K., Oliver, B.G.G., Krymskaya, V.P. & Black, J.L. 2011, 'Doxycycline inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion from TSC2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells', British Journal of Pharmacology, vol. 164, no. 1, pp. 83-92.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is characterized by the abnormal growth of smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) and cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma. LAM cell-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are thought to play a prominent role in the tissue destruction. The aim of this study was to determine whether doxycycline, a known MMP inhibitor, can inhibit LAM cell proliferation or mitochondrial function and/or modulate MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Wild-type and tuberous sclerosis complex-2 (TSC2)-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human LAM cells were derived from the lungs of LAM patients and airway smooth muscle cells from control subjects. Cells were stimulated with FBS with or without doxycycline for up to 9 days. Proliferation was assessed by manual cell counts and MTT assay, MMP production by zymography and ELISA, and TIMP production using elisa. KEY RESULTS Doxycycline did not change FBS-induced proliferation in MEFs or human cells. However, doxycycline did reduce metabolic activity of both wild-type and TSC2-null MEFs and LAM cells, but had no effect on control cells. Furthermore, doxycycline reduced MMP-2 from MEFs and decreased active-MMP-2 from LAM cells but had no effect on TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 from human LAM cells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Doxycycline decreased MMP levels and cell metabolic activity, which raises the possibility of therapeutic efficacy in LAM. &&copy;2011 The British Pharmacological Society.;Kuo, C., Lim, S., King, N.J.C., Johnston, S.L., Burgess, J.K., Black, J.L. & Oliver, B.G. 2011, 'Rhinovirus infection induces extracellular matrix protein deposition in asthmatic and nonasthmatic airway smooth muscle cells', American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology, vol. 300, no. 6, pp. L951-L957.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Airway remodeling, which includes increases in the extracellular matrix (ECM), is a characteristic feature of asthma and is correlated to disease severity. Rhinovirus (RV) infections are associated with increased risk of asthma development in young children and are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations. We examined whether viral infections can increase ECM deposition and whether this increased ECM modulates cell proliferation and migration. RV infection of nonasthmatic airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells significantly increased the deposition of fibronectin (40% increase, n = 12) and perlecan (80% increase, n = 14), while infection of asthmatic ASM cells significantly increased fibronectin (75% increase, n = 9) and collagen IV (15% increase, n = 9). We then treated the ASM cells with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, imiquimod, and pure RV RNA and were able to show that the mechanism through which RV induced ECM deposition was via the activation of TLR3 and TLR7/8. Finally, we assessed whether the virus-induced ECM was bioactive by measuring the amount of migration and proliferation of virus-naive cells that seeded onto the ECM. Basically, ECM from asthmatic ASM cells induced twofold greater migration of virus-naive ASM cells than ECM from nonasthmatic ASM cells, and these rates of migration were further increased on RV-modulated ECM. Increased migration on the RV-modulated ECM was not due to increased cell proliferation, as RV-modulated ECM decreased the proliferation of virus-naive cells. Our results suggest that viruses may contribute to airway remodeling through increased ECM deposition, which in turn may contribute to increased ASM mass via increased cell migration. &&copy;2011 the American Physiological Society.;Tovey, E.R., Ng, D.S.Y., Stelzer-Braid, S., Rawlinson, W.D. & Oliver, B.G. 2011, 'Erratum: Children with asthma and no URTI, more commonly have rhinovirus in their exhaled breath, than in mucous (J Allergy Clin Immunol (2009) 123 (S171))', Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, vol. 127, no. 2, p. 551.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Ge, Q., Moir, L.M., Black, J.L., Oliver, B.G. & Burgess, J.K. 2010, 'TGF?1 induces IL-6 and inhibits IL-8 release in human bronchial epithelial cells: The role of Smad2/3', Journal of Cellular Physiology, vol. 225, no. 3, pp. 846-854.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells contribute to asthmatic airway inflammation by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and transforming growth factor (TGF)?1, all of which are elevated in asthmatic airways. This study examines the signaling pathways leading to TGF?1 induced IL-6 and IL-8 in primary HBE cells from asthmatic and non-asthmatic volunteers. HBE cells were stimulated with TGF?1 in the presence or absence of signaling inhibitors. IL-6 and IL-8 protein and mRNA were measured by ELISA and real-time PCR respectively, and cell signaling kinases by Western blot. TGF?1 increased IL-6, but inhibited IL-8 production in both asthmatic and non-asthmatic cells, however, TGF induced significantly more IL-6 in asthmatic cells. Inhibition of JNK MAP kinase partially reduced TGF?1 induced IL-6 in both cell groups. TGF?1 induced Smad2 phosphorylation, and blockade of Smad2/3 prevented both the TGF?1 modulated IL-6 increase and the decrease in IL-8 production in asthmatic and non-asthmatic cells. Inhibition of Smad2/3 also increased basal IL-8 release in asthmatic cells but not in non-asthmatic cells. Using CHIP assays we demonstrated that activated Smad2 bound to the IL-6, but not the IL-8 promoter region. We conclude that the Smad2/3 pathway is the predominant TGF?1 signaling pathway in HBE cells, and this is altered in asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells. Understanding the mechanism of aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokine production in asthmatic airways will allow the development of alternative ways to control airway inflammation. &&copy;2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;Lau, J.Y., Oliver, B.G., Baraket, M., Beckett, E.L., Hansbro, N.G., Moir, L.M., Wilton, S.D., Williams, C., Foster, P.S., Hansbro, P.M., Black, J.L. & Burgess, J.K. 2010, 'Fibulin-1 is increased in asthma - a novel mediator of airway remodeling?', PLoS ONE, vol. 5, no. 10.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: The extracellular matrix is a dynamic and complex network of macromolecules responsible for maintaining and influencing cellular functions of the airway. The role of fibronectin, an extracellular matrix protein, is well documented in asthma. However, the expression and function of fibulin-1, a secreted glycoprotein which interacts with fibronectin, has not been reported. Fibulin-1 is widely expressed in basement membranes in many organs including the lung. There are four isoforms in humans (A-D) of which fibulin-1C and 1D predominate. The objective of this study was to study the expression of fibulin-1 in volunteers with and without asthma, and to examine its function in vitro. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used immunohistochemistry and dot-blots to examine fibulin-1 levels in bronchial biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum. Real-time PCR for fibulin-1C and 1D, and ELISA and western blotting for fibulin-1 were used to study the levels in airway smooth muscle cells. The function of fibulin-1C was determined by assessing its role, using an antisense oligonucleotide, in cell proliferation, migration and wound healing. A murine model of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was used to explore the biological significance of fibulin-1. Levels of fibulin-1 were significantly increased in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 21 asthmatics compared with 11 healthy volunteers. In addition fibulin-1 was increased in asthma derived airway smooth muscle cells and fibulin-1C contributed to the enhanced proliferation and wound repair in these cells. These features were reversed when fibulin-1C was suppressed using an antisense oligomer. In a mouse model of AHR, treatment with an AO inhibited the development of AHR to methacholine. Conclusions: Our data collectively suggest fibulin-1C may be worthy of further investigation as a target for airway remodeling in asthma. &&copy;2010 Lau et al.;Trian, T., Moir, L.M., Ge, Q., Burgess, J.K., Kuo, C., King, N.J.C., Reddel, H.K., Black, J.L., Oliver, B.G. & McParland, B.E. 2010, 'Rhinovirus-induced exacerbations of asthma: How is the?2- adrenoceptor implicated?', American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology, vol. 43, no. 2, pp. 227-233.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Rhinovirus (RV) infections are the major cause of asthma exacerbations in children and adults. Under normal circumstances, asthmatic airway obstruction improves spontaneously or characteristically briskly in response to inhaled?2-adrenergic receptor (?2AR) agonists. During virus-associated exacerbations, an impaired response to?2AR agonists is observed, the reason for this is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of RV infection on airway smooth muscle?2AR function. The human cell line Beas-2B and primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were infected with RV (multiplicity of infection = 1). After 1 or 5 days for primary and Beas-2B cells, respectively, cell culture supernatants were harvested, UV-irradiated to inactivate RV, and applied to human airway smooth muscle cells for 3 days to assess modifications of?2AR function. RV conditioned medium from Beas-2B and HBECs decreased?2AR agonist-induced cAMP by 50 and 65%, respectively (n = 5, P 0.05). When cAMP was induced independently of the?2AR using forskolin, no impairment was found. Using flow cytometry, we demonstrated that this decrease was likely the result of?2AR desensitization because membrane but not total cell receptor?2AR was decreased. Pretreatment of HBECs and Beas-2B cells but not human airway smooth muscle cells with the corticosteroids dexamethasone or fluticasone abolished virus-mediated?2AR loss of function. This study shows that epithelial infection with RV induces a decrease of?2AR function on airway smooth muscle cells, potentially explaining the clinical observation of loss of?2AR agonist function during RV-induced asthma exacerbations.;Lau, J.Y., Oliver, B.G., Moir, L.M., Black, J.L. & Burgess, J.K. 2010, 'Differential expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor? and cyclin D1 does not affect proliferation of asthma-and non-asthma-derived airway smooth muscle cells', Respirology, vol. 15, no. 2, pp. 303-312.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background and objective: Airway remodelling involves thickening of the airway smooth muscle (ASM) bulk. Proliferation of asthma-derived ASM cells is increased in vitro, but underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-? (PPAR?) regulates the cell cycle. It is suggested that PPAR? agonists have anti-inflammatory effects, which may be valuable in the treatment of asthma, but information regarding their antiproliferative properties in ASM is lacking. Although corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation, in vitro they inhibit proliferation in only non-asthma ASM cells by reducing cyclin D1. We therefore investigated the effects of mitogenic stimulation (foetal bovine serum (FBS)), and a PPAR? ligand (ciglitazone), on PPAR? and cyclin D1 expression and proliferation of ASM cells. In addition, we examined the effects of ciglitazone on ASM cell proliferation. Methods: We assessed PPAR? and cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels using quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Cell proliferation was assessed using bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Results: In the presence of 5% FBS, PPAR? and cyclin D1 expression decreased over time in non-asthmatic cells but increased in asthmatic cells (compared with sub-confluent cells). FBS-induced proliferation of asthmatic cells increased at all time points, but occurred only at day 7 with non-asthmatic cells (compared with unstimulated time-matched control). Ciglitazone increased PPAR? expression in both groups, but did not alter cell proliferation, while fluticasone increased PPAR? protein only in asthmatic cells. Conclusions: Although in the presence of a mitogenic stimulus, PPAR? was differentially expressed in asthma-and non-asthma-derived ASM, its expression was not related to the increased proliferation observed in asthmatic ASM. &&copy;2009 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology.;Burgess, J.K., Boustany, S., Moir, L.M., Weckmann, M., Lau, J.Y., Grafton, K., Baraket, M., Hansbro, P.M., Hansbro, N.G., Foster, P.S., Black, J.L. & Oliver, B.G. 2010, 'Reduction of tumstatin in asthmatic airways contributes to angiogenesis, inflammation, and hyperresponsiveness', American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, vol. 181, no. 2, pp. 106-115.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Rationale: Angiogenesis is a prominent feature of remodeling in asthma.

Additionally, specific histone marks associated with dosage compensation and active chromatin marks on the male X chromosome are also enriched on the X chromosomes of females, albeit to a lesser degree.Conclusions: Our data indicate that X chromatin structure is fundamentally different from autosome structure in both sexes. We suggest that the differences between the X chromosomes and autosomes in females are a consequence of mechanisms that have evolved to ensure sufficient X chromosome expression in the soma of males. &&copy;2010 Zhang and Oliver, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;Black, J.L., Oliver, B.G.G. & Roth, M. 2009, 'Molecular mechanisms of combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting?-agonists', Chest, vol. 136, no. 4, pp. 1095-1100.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The treatment of asthma relies on the use of the following two major drug classes:?2-agonists, both short acting and long acting, and corticosteroids (CSs). Although the properties of each drug class are well described, their use in combination delivered either separately or through one device has provided some clear and important clinical advantages. The mechanisms underlying these interactions have emerged as novel and provocative.?2-Agonists can stimulate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and promote its translocation to the nucleus, resulting in increased CS-mediated gene transcription. In structural airway cells, such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle, this gene transcription is associated with the formation of a complex between the GR and another transcription factor, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-?. Airway smooth muscle cells from persons with asthma are deficient in C/EBP-?, which may explain the finding that CSs do not inhibit the proliferation of these cells in vitro. Whether this deficiency can explain the increased bulk of muscle in the asthmatic airway remains to be established.?2-Agonists can inhibit mast cell mediator release, but this response is susceptible to desensitization, a process that CSs can inhibit. CSs also can increase the transcription of the?2- receptor gene in the lung and the nasal mucosa. These effects of CSs mitigate against the reduced transcription of?2-receptors, which occurs as a consequence of long-term?2-agonist administration. Delineation of the exact mechanisms underlying these effects will ensure rational, direct therapy. &&copy;2009 American College of Chest Physicians.;Burgess, J.K., Ceresa, C., Johnson, S.R., Kanabar, V., Moir, L.M., Nguyen, T.B., Oliver, B.G.G., Schuliga, M. & Ward, J. 2009, 'Tissue and matrix influences on airway smooth muscle function', Pulmonary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, vol. 22, no. 5, pp. 379-387.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Asthma is characterized by structural changes in the airways - airway remodelling. These changes include an increase in the bulk of the airway smooth muscle (ASM) and alterations in the profile of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the airway wall. The mechanisms leading to airway remodelling are not well understood. ASM cells have the potential to play a key role in these processes through the production and release of ECM proteins. The ASM cells and ECM proteins are each able to influence the behaviour and characteristics of the other. The modified ECM profile in the asthmatic airway may contribute to the altered behaviour of the ASM cells, such responses to ECM proteins are modulated through the cell surface expression of integrin receptors. ASM cells from asthmatic individuals express different levels of some integrin subunits compared to nonasthmatic ASM cells, which have the potential to further influence their responses to the ECM proteins in the airways. ECM homeostasis requires the presence and activation of matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, which in turn modulate the interaction of the ASM cells and the ECM proteins. Furthermore, the complex interactions of the ASM cells and the ECM in the asthmatic airways and the role played by external stimuli, such as viral infections, to modulate airway remodelling are currently unknown. This review summarises our current understanding of the influence of the ECM on ASM function. &&copy;2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The exhaled aerosols generated by coughing, talking, and breathing were sampled in 50 subjects using a novel mask, and analyzed using PCR for nine respiratory viruses. The exhaled samples from a subset of 10 subjects who were PCR positive for rhinovirus were also examined by cell culture for this virus. Of the 50 subjects, among the 33 with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections, 21 had at least one virus detected by PCR, while amongst the 17 asymptomatic subjects, 4 had a virus detected by PCR. Overall, rhinovirus was detected in 19 subjects, influenza in 4 subjects, parainfluenza in 2 subjects, and human metapneumovirus in 1 subject. Two subjects were co-infected. Of the 25 subjects who had virus-positive nasal mucus, the same virus type was detected in 12 breathing samples, 8 talking samples, and in 2 coughing samples. In the subset of exhaled samples from 10 subjects examined by culture, infective rhinovirus was detected in 2.

These cytokines activate signal transduction pathways, including Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling. Although the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family protein, a negative regulator of the Janus kinase/STAT signaling pathway, contributes to helper T cell differentiation during immune responses, the role of SOCS proteins within the structural cells of a target organ has not been clarified in allergy. Objectives: To study the local function of SOCS in the development of asthma. Methods: We used mouse models of IL-13- and ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway disease. Airway smooth muscle cells were cultured from patients with asthma. Measurements and Main Results: The administration of IL-13 induced not only airway responses but also SOCS1 expression at the local inflammatory site. The up-regulated SOCS1 markedly suppressed IL-13-dependent STAT6 activation and eotaxin expression and subsequently down-regulated IL-13-induced airway inflammatory responses. The inactivation of SOCS1 induced airway hyperresponsiveness after IL-13 treatment even in hyporesponsive C57BL/6 background mice. In an OVA-induced model of allergic airway disease, allergen exposure up-regulated local SOCS1 expression, and the induction of SOCS1 in the airways attenuated allergen-induced airway responses. Inactivation of IL-13 inhibited SOCS1 induction in a model of allergic airway disease. Interestingly, airway smooth muscle cells from individuals with asthma had impaired upregulation of SOCS1 after IL-13 stimulation. Conclusions: SOCS1 induction by IL-13 in airway structural cells is critical to negatively control allergic airway disease.;Krimmer, D.I., Loseli, M., Hughes, J.M., Oliver, B.G.G., Moir, L.M., Hunt, N.H., Black, J.L. & Burgess, J.K. 2009, 'CD40 and OX40 ligand are differentially regulated on asthmatic airway smooth muscle', Allergy: European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, vol. 64, no. 7, pp. 1074-1082.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: CD40 and OX40 Ligand (OX40L) are cell-surface molecules expressed on airway smooth muscle (ASM) that can enhance inflammatory cell activation and survival. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) and interferon-gamma (IFN-?) on ASM CD40 and OX40L expression. Methods: CD40 and OX40L expression on human ASM cells from asthmatic and nonasthmatic donors following stimulation with TNF-? and/or IFN-? was measured using cell-surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. Involvement of signalling pathway was investigated with pharmacological inhibitors. Soluble TNF receptor levels were quantified by ELISA. Results: Interferon-? and TNF-? synergistically increased CD40 expression to a greater extent on asthmatic than on nonasthmatic ASM. In contrast, IFN-? reduced TNF-?-induced OX40L expression to a similar extent in both cell types. TNF-? and IFN-? induced CD40 via nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 in both cell types and modulated OX40L via NF-?B and c-Jun N terminal kinase in nonasthmatic cells. Similar effects on the induction of OX40L in asthmatic cells were seen with NF-?B, but these were not statistically significant. The reduced OX40L expression with TNF-? and IFN-? involved extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 activation. Conclusion: Asthmatic ASM may modulate airway inflammation locally by increasing CD40 and OX40L expression in response to cytokines. IFN-? may regulate ASM pro-inflammatory actions by differentially modulating ASM CD40 and OX40L expression. &&copy;2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.;Seidel, P., Merfort, I., Hughes, J.M., Oliver, B.G.G., Tamm, M. & Roth, M. 2009, 'Dimethylfumarate inhibits NF-?B function at multiple levels to limit airway smooth muscle cell cytokine secretion', American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology, vol. 297, no. 2, pp. L326-L339.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The antipsoriatic dimethylfumarate (DMF) has been anecdotically reported to reduce asthma symptoms and to improve quality of life of asthma patients. DMF decreases the expression of proinflammatory mediators by inhibiting the transcription factor NF-?B and might therefore be of interest for the therapy of inflammatory lung diseases. In this study, we determined the effect of DMF on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB- and TNF?-induced asthma-relevant cytokines and NF-?B activation by primary human asthmatic and nonasthmatic airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC). Confluent nonasthmatic and asthmatic ASMC were incubated with DMF (0.1-100?M) and/or dexamethasone (0.0001-0.1?M), NF-?B p65 siRNA (100 nM), the NF-?B inhibitor helenalin (1?M) before stimulation with PDGF-BB or TNF? (10 ng/ml). Cytokine release was measured by ELISA. NF-?B, mitogen and stress-activated kinase (MSK-1), and CREB activation was determined by immunoblotting and EMSA. TNF?-induced eotaxin, RANTES, and IL-6 as well as PDGF-BB-induced IL-6 expression was inhibited by DMF and by dexamethasone from asthmatic and nonasthmatic ASMC, but the combination of both drugs showed no glucocorticoid sparing effect in either of the two groups. NF-?B p65 siRNA and/or the NF-?B inhibitor helenalin reduced PDGF-BB- and TNF?-induced cytokine expression, suggesting the involvement of NF-?B signaling. DMF inhibited TNF?-induced NF-?B p65 phosphorylation, NF-?B nuclear entry, and NF-?B-DNA complex formation, whereas PDGF-BB appeared not to activate NF-?B within 60 min. Both stimuli induced the phosphorylation of MSK-1, NF-?B p65 at Ser276, and CREB, and all were inhibited by DMF. These data suggest that DMF downregulates cytokine secretion not only by inhibiting NF-?B but a wider range of NF-?B-linked signaling proteins, which may explain its potential beneficial effect in asthma.

Exacerbations of these diseases are also frequently associated with bacterial and atypical bacterial infection. Alveolar macrophages are the major immune cells in the airways and are important in defence against bacterial infections. Methods: The authors investigated whether rhinovirus modifies cytokine release, the pattern recognition receptor expression and phagocytosis by human alveolar macrophages in response to bacterial products. Results: Viable rhinovirus was detected in macrophages up to 3 days after exposure and viral RNA expression persisted for 10 days. Infectious but not UV inactivated rhinovirus increased tumour necrosis factor? (TNF?) and interleukin (IL)8 release by macrophages. In contrast, infectious rhinovirus impaired lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid induced TNF? and IL8 secretion by macrophages. Rhinovirus induced impairment of macrophage antibacterial immune responses did not involve IL10, prostaglandin E2 or downregulation of Toll-like receptor 2. Furthermore, the macrophage phagocytic response to labelled bacterial particles, but not to latex beads, was impaired. Conclusion: The authors have identified impairment of cytokine responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid by alveolar macrophages in response to infectious rhinovirus.

However, few studies have investigated the contractility of airway smooth muscle (ASM) from these patients. The purpose of this study was to establish a method to measure contraction of ASM cells by embedding them into a collagen gel, and to compare the contraction between subjects with and without asthma. Methods: Gel contraction to histamine was examined in floating gels containing cultured ASM cells from subjects with and without asthma following overnight incubation while unattached (method 1) or attached (method 2) to casting plates. Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase protein levels were also examined. Results: Collagen gels containing ASM cells reduced in size when stimulated with histamine in a concentration-dependent manner and reached a maximum at a mean (SE) of 15.7 (1.2) min. This gel contraction was decreased by inhibitors for phospholipase C (U73122), myosin light chain kinase (ML-7) and Rho kinase (Y27632). When comparing the two patient groups, the maximal decreased area of gels containing ASM cells from patients with asthma was 19 (2)% (n = 8) using method 1 and 22 (3)% (n = 6) using method 2, both of which were greater than that of cells from patients without asthma: 13 (2)% (n = 9, p = 0.05) and 10 (4)% (n = 5, p = 0.024), respectively. Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase levels were not different between the two groups. Conclusion: The increased contraction of asthmatic ASM cells may be responsible for exaggerated bronchial constriction in asthma.;Ammit, A.J., Moir, L.M., Oliver, B.G., Hughes, J.M., Alkhouri, H., Ge, Q., Burgess, J.K., Black, J.L. & Roth, M. 2007, 'Effect of IL-6 trans-signaling on the pro-remodeling phenotype of airway smooth muscle', American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology, vol. 292, no. 1, pp. L199-L206.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Increased levels of IL-6 are documented in asthma, but its contribution to the pathology is unknown. Asthma is characterized by airway wall thickening due to increased extracellular matrix deposition, inflammation, angiogenesis, and airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass. IL-6 binds to a specific membrane-bound receptor, IL-6 receptor-? (mIL-6R?), and subsequently to the signaling protein gp130. Alternatively, IL-6 can bind to soluble IL-6 recpetor-? (sIL-6R?) to stimulate membrane receptor-deficient cells, a process called trans-signaling. We discovered that primary human ASM cells do not express mIL-6R? and, therefore, investigated the effect of IL-6 trans-signaling on the pro-remodeling phenotype of ASM. ASM required sIL-6R? to activate signal transducer and activator 3, with no differences observed between cells from asthmatic subjects compared with controls. Further analysis revealed that IL-6 alone or with sIL-6R? did not induce release of matrix-stimulating factors (including connective tissue growth factor, fibronectin, or integrins) and had no effect on mast cell adhesion to ASM or ASM proliferation. However, in the presence of sIL-6R?, IL-6 increased eotaxin and VEGF release and may thereby contribute to local inflammation and vessel expansion in airway walls of asthmatic subjects. As levels of sIL-6R? are increased in asthma, this demonstration of IL-6 trans-signaling in ASM has relevance to the development of airway remodeling.

The effect of current asthma therapies on this release is not known. Objective: We examined the effect of corticosteroids, long-acting? 2-agonists, and a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor on ASM-released connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), collagen I, fibronectin, versican, and IL-6. Methods: Airway smooth muscle cells from individuals with and without asthma were stimulated with TGF-? with or without the drugs and CTGF and ECM protein expression measured by real-time PCR, cell surface, or matrix-associated ELISA. IL-6 release was measured by ELISA. Bronchial rings from individuals without asthma were incubated with TGF-? with or without the drugs. Results: Neither corticosteroids nor long-acting? 2-agonists reduced TGF-?-induced CTGF, collagen I, or fibronectin in either cell type, whereas corticosteroids alone induced the expression of CTGF, collagen I, and fibronectin. These drugs did not prevent the accumulation of TGF-?-induced proteins in bronchial rings, whereas the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast inhibited TGF-?-induced CTGF, collagen I, and fibronectin. Conclusion: In our model, current asthma therapies are not able to inhibit matrix protein deposition from ASM cells. The results of this study suggest that the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast may have a role in regulating the ECM and therefore aspects of airway remodeling in asthma. Clinical implications: Although current asthma therapies are effective in reducing inflammation and symptoms, reversal or prevention of structural changes contributing to remodeling may require additional therapy, which could include PDE4 inhibitors. &&copy;2006 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.;Oliver, B.G.G., Johnston, S.L., Baraket, M., Burgess, J.K., King, N.J.C., Roth, M., Lim, S. & Black, J.L. 2006, 'Increased proinflammatory responses from asthmatic human airway smooth muscle cells in response to rhinovirus infection', Respiratory Research, vol. 7.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: Exacerbations of asthma are associated with viral respiratory tract infections, of which rhinoviruses (RV) are the predominant virus type. Airway smooth muscle is important in asthma pathogenesis, however little is known about the potential interaction of RV and human airway smooth muscle cells (HASM). We hypothesised that rhinovirus induction of inflammatory cytokine release from airway smooth muscle is augmented and differentially regulated in asthmatic compared to normal HASM cells. Methods: HASM cells, isolated from either asthmatic or non-asthmatic subjects, were infected with rhinovirus. Cytokine production was assayed by ELISA, ICAM-1 cell surface expression was assessed by FACS, and the transcription regulation of IL-6 was measured by luciferase activity. Results: RV-induced IL-6 release was significantly greater in HASM cells derived from asthmatic subjects compared to non-asthmatic subjects. This response was RV specific, as 5% serum- induced IL-6 release was not different in the two cell types. Whilst serum stimulated IL-8 production in cells from both subject groups, RV induced IL-8 production in only asthmatic derived HASM cells. The transcriptional induction of IL-6 was differentially regulated via C/EBP in the asthmatic and NF-?B + AP-1 in the non-asthmatic HASM cells. Conclusion: This study demonstrates augmentation and differential transcriptional regulation of RV specific innate immune response in HASM cells derived from asthmatic and non-asthmatics, and may give valuable insight into the mechanisms of RV-induced asthma exacerbations. &&copy;2006 Oliver et al, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;Oliver, B.G. & Black, J.L. 2006, 'Airway smooth muscle and asthma', Allergology International, vol. 55, no. 3, pp. 215-223.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;The airway smooth muscle is the key determinant of airway narrowing in asthma but its function in the absence of disease is unknown. Evidence for an intrinsic abnormality in the muscle in asthma is only just emerging. The airway smooth muscle is not merely a contractile cell, but also one which determines the composition of, and interacts with the extracellular matrix, and which may participate in inflammatory and allergic reactions and viral infections. The reason for the differences which have been observed in the in vitro properties of airway smooth muscle derived from asthmatic individuals may result from an inherent \"supercontractility\", an increased tendency to proliferate due to the absence of an inhibitory transcription factor C/EBP-?, the influence of an altered extracellular matrix and/or a decrease in release of factors such as PGE2 which would under normal circumstances inhibit both proliferation and contraction. Although long acting beta agonists and corticosteroids are successful treatments for inflammation and bronchoconstriction, the structural changes which constitute airway remodelling may require additional therapeutic intervention, the nature of which will be determined by thorough investigation of the mechanisms underlying the asthmatic phenotype. &&copy;2006 Japanese Society of Allergology.;Sharma, R., Von Haehling, S., Rauchhaus, M., Bolger, A.P., Genth-Zotz, S., Doehner, W., Oliver, B., Poole-Wilson, P.A., Volk, H.D., Coats, A.J.S., Adcock, I.M. & Anker, S.D. 2005, 'Whole blood endotoxin responsiveness in patients with chronic heart failure: The importance of serum lipoproteins', European Journal of Heart Failure, vol. 7, no. 4, pp. 479-484.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Background: Endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] may be an important stimulus for cytokine release in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We sought to investigate the relationship between whole blood endotoxin responsiveness and serum lipoprotein concentrations. It is not known if low-dose LPS is sufficient to stimulate immune activation. Methods and results: Whole blood from 32 CHF patients (mean age 66&&plusmn;2 years, NYHA class 2.7&&plusmn;0.2, five female) and 11 healthy control subjects (mean age 47&&plusmn;4 years, six female) was stimulated with LPS at nine different concentrations (0.001 to 10 ng/mL), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-?) release was quantified. Reference standard endotoxin at concentrations of 0, 0.6, 1, and 3 EU/ml was added to whole blood from nine CHF patients (age 64&&plusmn;9.1 years, all NYHA class II, eight male) and incubated for 6 h, the TNF-? production being measured. Serum lipoproteins were quantified using standard techniques. In CHF patients, there was an inverse relationship between whole blood TNF-? release and serum cholesterol which was strongest at 0.6 ng/mL of LPS (r=-0.53, p=0.002). A similar although weaker relationship was found for serum HDL. No such correlation was found in healthy subjects or with serum LDL (all r20.1). Low concentrations of LPS induced a stepwise increase in TNF-? release from whole blood to concentrations well above those seen in CHF. Conclusions: Serum lipoproteins may play an important role in regulating LPS bioactivity in CHF. Very low LPS activity, at levels seen in vivo in CHF, can induce significant TNF-? production ex vivo. &&copy;2004 European Society of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The current authors have previously identified abnormal behaviour of airway smooth muscle cells from patients with asthma. In this study, cells and tissue sections derived from patients with LAM (n=7), asthma (n=8), and nonasthmatic controls (n=9) were compared. The presence of the antigen human melanosome (HM)B-45 was investigated, along with the proliferation and release of extracellular matrix proteins, release of endogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), vascular endothelial growth factor and connective tissue growth factor, and the expression of integrins. Positive HMB-45 staining was found in all LAM patients and no controls. Proliferation of LAM cells was not different from control cells nor was its inhibition by?-agonists, corticosteroids, rapamycin or PGE2. However, endogenous PGE2 levels were markedly decreased in LAM cells, and this was associated with decreased expression of the inducible form of cyclooxygenase (COX-2). The increased levels of connective tissue growth factor seen in asthma cells were not observed in LAM. Elastin mRNA in response to transforming growth factor-? stimulation was markedly lower in LAM cells than either asthma or control cells. In conclusion, lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells exhibit abnormal properties in vitro that may contribute to pathophysiology and symptomatology in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Thus, a better understanding of the developmental regulation of the underlying epigenetic processes that include DNA methylation is required. We have, therefore, monitored the expression, by PCR, of the mRNAs of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs), and CpG binding protein (CGBP) in a developmental series of amplified cDNA samples derived from staged human ovarian follicles, oocytes, preimplantation embryos, human embryonic stem (hES) cells and in similar murine cDNA samples. Transcripts of these genes were detected in human ovarian follicles (DNMT3A, DNMT3b1, DNMT3b4, DNMT1, MDBs1-4, MeCP2, CGBP), germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes (DNMT3A, DNMT3b1, DNMT1, MDBs1-4, MeCP2, CGBP), mature oocytes (DNMT3A, DNMT3b1, DNMT1, CGBP), and preimplantation embryos (DNMT3A, DNMT3b1, DNMT1, DNMT3L, MBD2, MDB4, CGBP). Differential expression of DNMT3B gene transcripts in undifferentiated (DNMT3b1) and in vitro differentiated human ES cells (DNMT3b3) further demonstrated an association of the DNMT3b1 transcript variant with totipotent and pluripotent human cells. Significantly, whilst the murine Dnmt3L gene is both expressed and essential for imprint establishment during murine oogenesis, transcripts of the human DNMT3L gene were only detected after fertilisation. Therefore, the mechanisms and/or the timing of imprint establishment may differ in humans. &&copy;2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;Roche, N., Stirling, R.G., Lim, S., Oliver, B.G. & Chung, K.F. 2003, 'Regulation of protease-activated receptor-I in mononuclear cells by neutrophil proteases', Respiratory Medicine, vol. 97, no. 3, pp. 228-233.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Neutrophils and mononuclear cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Neutrophil-derived serine proteases, such as cathepsin G (CG) and neutrophil elastase (NE), may interact with mononuclear cells via protease-activated receptors (PARs), which are seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors activated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular N-terminus, and which, on activation, induce the release of several mediators and cytokines. We determined whether CG and NE could affect PAR-1 expression and function in mononuclear cells. Human blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 20 healthy donors. Surface and intracellular receptor expression and calcium mobilisation (using the calcium chelator, FLU03-AM) were studied by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS analysis). Positive controls, i.e. thrombin (0.1-100 mU/ml) and the PAR-1-activating peptide SFLLRN (100?M), induced a rapid and transient internalisation of PAR-1 in monocytes and lymphocytes. CG but not NE had a similar effect. By contrast, in monocytes intracellular calcium mobilisation was induced by thrombin and SFLLRN but not by CG and NE. Thus, CG can induce intracellular PAR-1 sequestration without activation of the receptor, and may act as an antagonist and prevent subsequent activation of PAR-1 in mononuclear cells. These findings may be of relevance to the pathogenesis of COPD. &&copy;2002 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.;Roche, N., Stirling, R.G., Lim, S., Oliver, B.G., Oates, T., Jazrawi, E., Caramori, G. & Chung, K.F. 2003, 'Effect of acute and chronic inflammatory stimuli on expression of protease-activated receptors 1 and 2 in alveolar macrophages', Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, vol. 111, no. 2, pp. 367-373.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Background: Protease-activated receptors 1 and 2 (PAR-1 and PAR-2) are 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors activated by serine proteases in many cell types, including monocytes-macrophages, leading to the production of proinflammatory mediators, cytokines, and growth factors. Objective: We determined the influence of chronic smoking and asthma on the expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 receptors on alveolar macrophages (AMs). Methods: We used RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry with confocal microscopy to determine mRNA and protein expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 in AMs obtained from healthy smokers, asthmatic patients, and healthy subjects. In addition, we examined the effect of IL-1? and LPS. Results: PAR1 mRNA was decreased, whereas PAR2 mRNA was increased in 24-hour cultured AMs from smokers when compared with values in AMs from healthy subjects. Paradoxically, there was a higher degree of PAR-1 protein staining in AMs from smokers, whereas PAR-2 staining was similar in smokers and healthy subjects. PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA and protein expression were similar in asthmatic patients and control subjects. IL-1? and LPS had no effect on PAR1 and PAR2 gene expression by AMs. Conclusions: There is a dissociation between gene and protein expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2. PAR-1 protein overexpression in AMs from smokers might be important in the pathophysiology of chronic airways disease.;Huntriss, J., Gosden, R., Hinkins, M., Oliver, B., Miller, D., Rutherford, A.J. & Picton, H.M. 2002, 'Isolation, characterization and expression of the human factor in the Germline alpha (FIGLA) gene in ovarian follicles and oocytes', Molecular Human Reproduction, vol. 8, no. 12, pp. 1087-1095.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;The Factor In the Germline alpha (FIG?) transcription factor regulates expression of the zona pellucida proteins ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3 and is essential for folliculogenesis in the mouse. Using the published mouse Figla sequence, BLAST searches identified a human chromosome 2 BAC clone with high sequence identity. Using PCR primers derived from this clone, amplicons derived from ovarian follicles and mature oocytes revealed 100% identity with the appropriate human BAC clone, the expected homology with the mouse Figla gene sequence, and homology on translation with the FIG? protein identified in the Japanese rice fish, medaka (Oryzias latipes). PCR expression profiling of this transcript revealed FIGLA mRNA expression in cDNA derived from ovarian follicles (5/5 samples from the primordial through to the secondary stage) mature oocytes (6/9 samples), and less frequently in preimplantation embryos (2/7 samples). Subsequent BLAST searches revealed the predicted full length coding sequence of the human FIG? protein which demonstrates 68 and 25% similarity overall to mouse and medaka proteins respectively, with 96 and 57% identity respectively within the basic helix-loop-helix region. This confirms our identification of the human homologue for this gene which maps to chromosome 2p12. Further work is required to understand its role in normal human oocyte development and the potential involvement in human infertility.;Oliver, B., Tomita, K., Keller, A., Caramori, G., Adcock, I., Chung, K.F., Barnes, P.J. & Lim, S. 2001, 'Low-dose theophylline does not exert its anti-inflammatory effects in mild asthma through upregulation of interleukin-10 in alveolar macrophages', Allergy: European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, vol. 56, no. 11, pp. 1087-1090.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Background: There is accumulating evidence that theophylline has anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effects. This may be, in part, mediated via an upregulation in the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. We determined whether low-dose theophylline (LDT) would increase the production of IL-10, and attenuate the production of proinflammmtory cytokines by alveolar macrophages. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study involving 15 steroid-free patients with mild asthma, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) were performed at the end of the treatment and placebo periods. Alveolar macrophages were cultured in vitro, and we measured their release of IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-?. We also measured IL-10 production in whole blood together with the number of monocytes and T cells expressing intracellular IL-10 by flow cytometry. Results: LDT did not increase the production of IL-10, or attenuate the production of GM-CSF or TNF-? by alveolar macrophages. However, after theophylline treatment, there was a significant reduction in mean (SD) (95% CI) BAL eosinophil number from 3.4 (1.7)% (95% CI 2.4-4.4) to 1.7 (1.0)% (95% CI 1.1-2.3) compared with placebo (P?0.05). Similarly, there was no increase in whole-blood IL-10 release or in the number of monocytes and T cells expressing intracellular IL-10 after treatment. Conclusions: LDT has an anti-inflammatory effect in asthma, however, this effect is not mediated via the production of IL-10 or the attenuation of GM-CSF or TNF-?. The mechanisms of theophylline activity remain to be determined.;Lim, S., Tomita, K., Carramori, G., Jatakanon, A., Oliver, B., Keller, A., Adcock, I., Chung, K.F. & Barnes, P.J. 2001, 'Low-dose theophylline reduces eosinophilic inflammation but not exhaled nitric oxide in mild asthma', American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, vol. 164, no. 2, pp. 273-276.;Theophylline is well-established in the management of asthma, and there is some evidence of an antiinflammatory effect in asthma. It is not known whether theophylline affects inflammatory markers such as sputum eosinophils and exhaled nitric oxide (NO) in patients with mild asthma not receiving inhaled steroid therapy. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of 15 patients with mild asthma, we assessed the effect of low-dose theophylline therapy (250 mg twice per day) on eosinophils in induced sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and airway biopsies at the end of both the treatment and placebo periods. Measurements of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) were made at the end of the active and placebo treatment periods of 5 wk each. Low-dose theophylline (mean serum level, 6.1 mg/L) led to a significant reduction in mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) sputum eosinophils from 11.3% (7.80-14.76%) to 8.0% (5.46-10.44%), BAL eosinophils from 3.4% (2.4-4.4%) to 1.7% (1.1-2.3%) and biopsy eosinophils from 1.83% (0.76-2.89%) to 1.20% (0.27-2.13%) compared with placebo (all p 0.05). There was no significant change in levels of exhaled NO or improvement in lung function and bronchial responsiveness. Low-dose theophylline induced antiinflammatory effects in asthma, reflected by a fall in airway eosinophils with no change in exhaled NO or changes in lung function.;Sam, L., Roche, N., Oliver, B.G., Mattos, W., Barnes, P.J. & Fan Chung, K. 2000, 'Balance of matrix metalloprotease-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 from alveolar macrophages in cigarette smokers: Regulation by interleukin-10', American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, vol. 162, no. 4 I, pp. 1355-1360.;An imbalance between proteases and antiproteases may play a role in emphysema, which is characterized by increased degradation of extracellular matrix, and in airway remodeling in chronic bronchitis and asthma, in which there is increased collagen deposition. We assessed the effect of smoking on release of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) and of its inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 (TIMP-1), from alveolar macrophages, and determined the effects of proinflammatory (interleukin [IL]-1? and lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) and antiinflammatory (IL-10) stimuli on the release of MMP-9 and TIMP-1. We performed bronchoalveolar lavage in 11 smokers and 11 nonsmokers, and cultured airway macrophages in the presence of control medium, IL-1?, and LPS. Airway macrophages from smokers released greater amounts of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 at baseline and in response to IL-1? and LPS than did those of nonsmokers. Airway macrophages from smokers produced more TNF-? and IL-10. IL-10 increased TIMP-1 release without modifying that of MMP-9, leading to a decrease in the MMP-9 to TIMP-1 ratio. Anti-IL-10 antibody had no effect on MMP-9 production induced by LPS. We conclude that the release of proteases and antiproteases by airway macrophages is increased in cigarette smokers, and can be regulated by exogenous IL-10.;Aaron, J.E., Oliver, B., Clarke, N. & Carter, D.H. 1999, 'Calcified microspheres as biological entities and their isolation from bone', Histochemical Journal, vol. 31, no. 7, pp. 455-470.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Calcified microspheres, about 1?m in diameter, appear at sites of bone formation where they invest the collagenous matrix, become confluent and disappear. Evidence that the particle boundaries are not lost with compaction but merely deformed is supported in section by the granular histochemical staining of the inorganic phase for bone salt, lipid, fibronectin and acid phosphatase in osteomalacic, acid-etched and normal human bone. Their persistence as discrete objects is confirmed by the application of methods for their isolation from the collagenous matrix of immature mouse calvarium and mature bovine femur. Five methods have been used to extract them and include (i) biochemical, (ii) chemical, (iii) mechanical, (iv) pyrogenous and (v) biological separation. Under the optical microscope, all isolates consisted of similar discrete objects and bridged assemblies, whose birefringence varied with treatment. After decalcification, their organic 'ghosts' remained. Each isolated microsphere had a complex substructure of clusters of non-collagenous calcified filaments surrounding a less dense centre. The filaments were 5 nm in diameter with a 5 nm periodicity and regular fine interfilamentous connections. It is concluded that the microspheres are independent, complex, pervasive and central to the containment (i.e. packaging) of calcium phosphate in bone.

AIMS: To: 1) ascertain 24-hour delirium point-prevalence in an Australian palliative care inpatient population, 2) test the feasibility and acceptability of the delirium measurement methodology. METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study. Delirium was measured in patients of two palliative care units using the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale, Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Descriptive statistics were used to report patient demographics, palliative care phase, function, delirium measure completion, and proportion of patients with a positive screen and diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients (n=47) had a mean age of 74 years (SD+10) and mostly malignant diagnoses (96%). All patients were screened for delirium, but few were capable of completing the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (n=2). One-third of patients (34%) screened positive for delirium and 19% were diagnosed as delirious according to the DSM-5. CONCLUSION: The Nursing Delirium Screening Scale and physician application of DSM-5 proved feasible and acceptable, while the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale did not. Patients' advanced age and proportions screening positive for delirium and diagnosed as delirious attest to the need to rapidly recognise, assess and respond to patients experiencing this distressing disorder while being cared for in palliative care inpatient settings.;Phillips, J.L., Lovell, M., Luckett, T., Agar, M., Green, A. & Davidson, P. 2015, 'Australian survey of current practice and guideline use in adult cancer pain assessment and management: The community nurse perspective', Collegian, vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 33-41.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2013 Australian College of Nursing Ltd. Background: Cancer pain remains a major public health concern. Despite effective treatments being available to manage the majority of cancer pain, this debilitating symptom is frequently under treated. As cancer has becomes a chronic disease a range of health professionals, including community nurses in Australia are increasingly caring for people living with cancer related pain. Yet, little is known about community nurses capacity to assess and manage cancer pain in accordance with best available evidence. Objectives: This study aimed to: identify the barriers and facilitators to adult cancer pain assessment and management as perceived by Australian health professionals, identify if cancer pain guidelines are currently used, identify barriers and facilitators to guideline use, and establish the need for Australian cancer pain guidelines. This article reports on community nurses' perceptions of managing cancer pain in the community setting. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered online. Invitations were circulated via peak bodies and clinical leaders seeking the views and experiences of health professionals involved in caring for people living with cancer pain. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the quantitative data, and thematic content analysis were used to describe the qualitative data. Results: Sixty-two community nurses responded to the survey, representing 29% of the total sample. These participants reported high levels of adherence to accepted cancer pain management practices in their workplace, with 71% nominating the Palliative Care Therapeutic Guideline V.3 as being most frequently used to manage community patients' cancer related pain. Key barriers to effective cancer pain management in the community were: difficulties accessing non-pharmacological interventions (89%), lack of coordination by multiple providers (89%), and impact of distance on ability to access pain-related services for...;Virdun, C., Brown, N., Phillips, J., Luckett, T., Agar, M., Green, A. & Davidson, P.M. 2015, 'Elements of optimal paediatric palliative care for children and young people: An integrative review using a systematic approach', Collegian, vol. 22, no. 4, pp. 421-431.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2014 Australian College of Nursing Ltd. Background: Models of palliative care need to address the unmet needs of children, young people and families. Objective: To undertake an integrative review to identify the key elements of optimal paediatric palliative care from the perspectives of children and young people with palliative care needs and their parents. Data sources: Electronic databases including CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO and AMED searched using combined terms for palliative care, service models and children along with reference lists of included studies. Study selection: Peer reviewed empirical studies reporting on evaluation of paediatric palliative care by children and young people with palliative care needs (0-19 years), or their families, published in English, between 2000 and 2013. The views of health professionals and grey literature were excluded. Quality appraisal completed by two researchers, consensus reached following discussion. Data extraction and synthesis: Data extracted by two researchers, entered into an electronic proforma and synthesised using a narrative approach. Results: Seven studies were identified of which two were quantitative, one was qualitative and four were mixed methods. Synthesis highlighted the need for tailored support enabling flexibility in care, with specific reference to location of care and access to psychosocial support, 24. h specialist support, respite care and sibling support. Conclusions: Paediatric palliative care should be flexible, responsive and tailored to the needs of children and their families. Robust evaluation of models of care that incorporate these elements is required to inform optimal care.;Sanderson, C., Quinn, S.J., Agar, M., Chye, R., Clark, K., Doogue, M., Fazekas, B., Lee, J., Lovell, M.R., Rowett, D., Spruyt, O. & Currow, D.C. 2015, 'Pharmacovigilance in hospice/palliative care: Net effect of gabapentin for neuropathic pain', BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care, vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 273-280.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Objective Hospice/palliative care patients may differ from better studied populations, and data from other populations cannot necessarily be extrapolated into hospice/palliative care clinical practice. Pharmacovigilance studies provide opportunities to understand the harms and benefits of medications in routine practice. Gabapentin, a?-amino butyric acid analogue antiepileptic drug, is commonly prescribed for neuropathic pain in hospice/palliative care. Most of the evidence however relates to nonmalignant, chronic pain syndromes (diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, central pain syndromes, fibromyalgia). The aim of this study was to quantify the immediate and short-term clinical benefits and harms of gabapentin in routine hospice/palliative care practice. Design Multisite, prospective, consecutive cohort. Population 127 patients, 114 of whom had cancer, who started gabapentin for neuropathic pain as part of routine clinical care. Settings 42 centres from seven countries. Data were collected at three time points-at baseline, at day 7 (and at any time, immediate and shortterm harms) and at day 21 (clinical benefits). Results At day 21, the average dose of gabapentin for those still using it (n=68) was 653mg/24h (range 0-1800mg) and 54 (42%) reported benefits, of whom 7 (6%) experienced complete pain resolution. Harms were reported in 39/127 (30%) patients at day 7, the most frequent of which were cognitive disturbance, somnolence, nausea and dizziness. Ten patients had their medication ceased due to harms. The presence of significant comorbidities, higher dose and increasing age increased the likelihood of harm. Conclusions Overall, 42% of people experienced benefit at a level that resulted in continued use at 21 days.;Currow, D.C., Quinn, S., Agar, M., Fazekas, B., Hardy, J., McCaffrey, N., Eckermann, S., Abernethy, A.P. & Clark, K. 2015, 'Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of octreotide in malignant bowel obstruction', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 49, no. 5, pp. 814-821.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Context Does octreotide reduce vomiting in cancer-associated bowel obstruction? Objectives To evaluate the net effect of adding octreotide or placebo to standardized therapies on the number of days free of vomiting for populations presenting with vomiting and inoperable bowel obstruction secondary to cancer or its treatment. Methods Twelve services enrolled people with advanced cancer presenting with vomiting secondary to bowel obstruction where surgery or anti-cancer therapies were not indicated immediately. In a double-blind study, participants were randomized to placebo or octreotide (600?g/24 hours by infusion). Both arms received standardized supportive therapy (infusion of ranitidine [200 mg/24 hours], dexamethasone [8 mg/24 hours], and parenteral hydration [10-20 mL/kg/24 hours]). The primary outcome was patient-reported days free of vomiting at 72 hours. Results In a study that recruited to the numbers identified in its power calculation, 87 participants provided data at 72 hours (45, octreotide arm). Seventeen people (octreotide) and 14 (placebo) were free of vomiting for 72 hours (P = 0.67). Mean days free of vomiting were 1.87 (SD 1.10, octreotide) and 1.69 (SD 1.15, placebo, P = 0.47). An adjusted multivariate regression of the incidence of vomiting over the study showed a reduced number of episodes of vomiting in the octreotide group (incidence rate ratio = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19-0.86, P = 0.019), however, people in the octreotide arm were 2.02 times more likely to be administered hyoscine butylbromide (P = 0.004), potentially reflecting increased colicky pain. Conclusion Although there was no reduction in the number of days free of vomiting, the multivariate analysis suggests that further study of somatostatin analogues in this setting is warranted.;Mowll, J., Lobb, E.A., Lane, L., Lacey, J., Chochinov, H.M., Kelly, B., Agar, M., Links, M. & Kearsley, J.H. 2015, 'A preliminary study to develop an intervention to facilitate communication between couples in advanced cancer', Palliative and Supportive Care, vol. 13, no. 5, pp. 1381-1390.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Copyright &&copy;Cambridge University Press 2015. Objective: Psychosocial interventions directed to couples where one has advanced cancer can reduce distress, enhance communication, and provide an opportunity for relational growth. The present study aimed to develop an intervention to facilitate communication about living with advanced cancer using the Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI) as the focus of a clinical interview with couples toward the end of life. Method: Couples were recruited from oncology and palliative care services at a Sydney hospital. After the PDI was developed and manualized as an intervention for couples, the PDI-Couple Interview (PDI-CI) was delivered by a clinical psychologist and comprised the following: (1) the patient completed the PDI, (2) the patient's identified partner completed the PDI about how they thought the patient was feeling, and (3) the clinician reviewed the results with the couple, summarizing areas of concurrence and discordance and facilitating discussion. Results: Some 34 couples were referred, of which 12 consented, 9 of whom completed the clinical interview. Reported benefits included enabling couples to express their concerns together, identifying differences in understanding, and giving permission to speak with each other. The focus of the interview around the PDI provided a structure that was particularly acceptable for men. Most couples confirmed that they were on the same page, and where differences were identified, it provided a forum for discussion and a mutual understanding of the challenges in managing advanced cancer within a supportive context. Significance of Results: Participant couples' experiences of the PDI-CI provide valuable insight into the benefits of this intervention. This preliminary study indicates that the intervention is a relatively simple means of enhancing closer communication and connection between couples where one has advanced cancer and may be an important adjunct in helping prepare couples f...;McCaffrey, N., Agar, M., Harlum, J., Karnon, J., Currow, D. & Eckermann, S. 2015, 'Better informing decision making with multiple outcomes cost-effectiveness analysis under uncertainty in ost-disutility space', PLoS ONE, vol. 10, no. 3.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 McCaffrey et al. Introduction: Comparing multiple, diverse outcomes with cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is important, yet challenging in areas like palliative care where domains are unamenable to integration with survival. Generic multi-attribute utility values exclude important domains and nonhealth outcomes, while partial analyses - where outcomes are considered separately, with their joint relationship under uncertainty ignored - lead to incorrect inference regarding preferred strategies. Objective: The objective of this paper is to consider whether such decision making can be better informed with alternative presentation and summary measures, extending methods previously shown to have advantages in multiple strategy comparison. Methods: Multiple outcomes CEA of a home-based palliative care model (PEACH) relative to usual care is undertaken in cost disutility (CDU) space and compared with analysis on the cost-effectiveness plane. Summary measures developed for comparing strategies across potential threshold values for multiple outcomes include: expected net loss (ENL) planes quantifying differences in expected net benefit, the ENL contour identifying preferred strategies minimising ENL and their expected value of perfect information, and cost-effectiveness acceptability planes showing probability of strategies minimising ENL.Results: Conventional analysis suggests PEACH is cost-effective when the threshold value per additional day at home (Kinf1/inf) exceeds 1,068 or dominated by usual care when only the proportion of home deaths is considered. In contrast, neither alternative dominate in CDU space where cost and outcomes are jointly considered, with the optimal strategy depending on threshold values. For example, PEACH minimises ENL when Kinf1/inf=2,000 and Kinf2/inf=2,000 (threshold value for dying at home), with a 51.6% chance of PEACH being cost-effective. Conclusion: Comparison in CDU space and associated summary measures have disti...;Lovell, M.R., Phillips, J., Luckett, T. & Agar, M. 2015, 'Improving the system for managing cancer pain', Internal Medicine Journal, vol. 45, no. 3, pp. 361-362.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Currow, D.C., Clark, K., Kamal, A., Collier, A., Agar, M.R., Lovell, M.R., Phillips, J.L. & Ritchie, C. 2015, 'The population burden of chronic symptoms that substantially predate the diagnosis of a life-limiting illness', Journal of Palliative Medicine, vol. 18, no. 6, pp. 480-485.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015. Many people in our communities live with symptoms for years or decades, something of relevance to hospice/palliative care clinicians and researchers. The proportion of people in the community at large who have a chronic symptom is likely to approximate the proportion of people referred to hospice/palliative care services with that same chronic symptom that pre-dates their life-limiting illness. Such patients may have different responsiveness to, and expectations from, symptomatic therapies, thus requiring more advanced approaches to symptom control. For researchers evaluating the impact of hospice/palliative care services, failing to account for people with long-term refractory symptoms pre-dating their life-limiting illness may systematically underestimate services' benefits. Observational symptom prevalence studies reported in hospice/palliative care to date have not accounted for people with long-term refractory symptoms, potentially systematically overestimating symptoms attributed to life-limiting illnesses. Cross-sectional community prevalence rates of key chronic refractory symptoms largely unrelated to their life-limiting illness reflect the likely prevalence on referral to hospice/palliative care: fatigue (up to 35%), pain (12%-31%), pain with neuropathic characteristics (9%), constipation (2%-29%), dyspnea (4%-9%), cognitive impairment (10% of people 65 years old, 30% of people 85 years old), anxiety (4%), and depression (lifetime incidence 2%-15%, one year prevalence 3%). Prospective research is needed to establish (1) the prevalence and severity of chronic symptoms that pre-date the diagnosis of a life-limiting illness in people referred to hospice/palliative care services, comparing this to whole-of-population estimates, and (2) whether this group is disproportionately represented in people with refractory symptoms.;Lovell, M., Luckett, T., Boyle, F., Stubbs, J., Phillips, J., Davidson, P.M., Olver, I., von Dincklage, J. & Agar, M. 2015, 'Adaptation of international guidelines on assessment and management of cancer pain for the Australian context', Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Aim: To develop clinical practice guidelines for screening, assessing and managing cancer pain in Australian adults. Methods: This three-phase project utilized the ADAPTE approach to adapt international cancer pain guidelines for the Australian setting. A Working Party was established to define scope, screen guidelines for adaptation and develop recommendations to support better cancer pain control through screening, assessment, pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, and patient education. Recommendations with limited evidence were referred to Expert Panels for advice before the draft guidelines were opened for public consultation via the Cancer Council Australia Cancer Guidelines Wiki platform in late 2012. All comments were reviewed by the Working Party and the guidelines were revised accordingly. Results: Screening resulted in six international guidelines being included for adaptation - those developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (2008), National Health Service Quality Improvement Scotland (2009), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012), European Society of Medical Oncology (2011), European Association for Palliative Care (2011, 2012) and National Institute of Clinical Excellence (2012). Guideline adaptation resulted in 55 final recommendations. The guidelines were officially launched in November 2013. Conclusion: International guidelines can be efficiently reconfigured for local contexts using the ADAPTE approach. Availability of the guidelines via the Cancer Council Australia Wiki is intended to promote uptake and enable recommendations to be kept up to date.

Aim: To develop clinical practice guidelines for screening, assessing and managing cancer pain in Australian adults. Methods: This three-phase project utilized the ADAPTE approach to adapt international cancer pain guidelines for the Australian setting. A Working Party was established to define scope, screen guidelines for adaptation and develop recommendations to support better cancer pain control through screening, assessment, pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, and patient education. Recommendations with limited evidence were referred to Expert Panels for advice before the draft guidelines were opened for public consultation via the Cancer Council Australia Cancer Guidelines Wiki platform in late 2012. All comments were reviewed by the Working Party and the guidelines were revised accordingly. Results: Screening resulted in six international guidelines being included for adaptation - those developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (2008), National Health Service Quality Improvement Scotland (2009), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012), European Society of Medical Oncology (2011), European Association for Palliative Care (2011, 2012) and National Institute of Clinical Excellence (2012).

Objectives. A drive to promote advance care planning at a population level has led to a proliferation of online advance care directive (ACD) templates but little information to guide consumer choice. The current study aimed to appraise the quality of online ACD templates promoted for use in Australia. Methods. A systematic review of online Australian ACD templates was conducted in February 2014. ACD templates were identified via Google searches, and quality was independently appraised by two reviewers against criteria from the 2011 report A National Framework for Advance Care Directives. Bias either towards or against future medical treatment was assessed using criteria designed to limit subjectivity. Results. Fourteen online ACD templates were included, all of which were available only in English. Templates developed by Southern Cross University best met the framework criteria. One ACD template was found to be biased against medical treatment - the Dying with Dignity Victoria Advance Healthcare Directive. Conclusions. More research is needed to understand how online resources can optimally elicit and record consumers' individual preferences for future care. Future iterations of the framework should address online availability and provide a simple rating system to inform choice and drive quality improvement. What is known about the topic? Online availability of ACD templates provides consumers with an opportunity for advance care planning outside of formal healthcare settings. While online availability has advantages, there is a risk that templates may be biased either for or against medical treatment and may not elicit directives that are appropriately informed by reflection on personal values and discussion with family and health professionals. What does this paper add? This is the first attempt at monitoring the quality and bias of online ACD templates designed for use in Australia. What are the implications for practitioners?

Aims and objectives: To explore nurse perceptions of the feasibility of integrating the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale into practice within the inpatient palliative care setting. Background: Delirium occurs frequently in palliative care inpatient populations, yet is under-recognised. Exploring feasibility of delirium screening tools in this setting can provide insights into how recognition can be improved. Design: This was a qualitative study using a focus group methodology. Method: Four semi-structured focus groups were conducted with 21 nurses working in two Australian palliative care units. Focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse the data. Results: Three major themes were identified: (1) Delirium screening using the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale is feasible, but then what? (2) Nuances, ambiguity and clinical complexity, and (3) Implementing structured processes requires firmer foundations. Themes describe how nurses perceived the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale to be an easy and brief screening tool which raised their awareness of delirium. They were largely willing to adopt it into practice, yet had uncertainty and misunderstandings of the tool specifically and delirium screening generally, application in a palliative care context, interventions for delirium and impact of screening on medical practice. Conclusion: The Nursing Delirium Screening Scale is feasible for use in a palliative care inpatient setting, but requires investigation of its psychometric properties before routine use in this patient population. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses require understanding of delirium, tailored guidance and a united approach with doctors to support their effective use of a delirium screening tool in the palliative care unit. Delirium practice change in this setting will also require nurses to become more active leaders and collaborators within their interdi...;Agar, M., Koh, E.S., Gibbs, E., Barnes, E.H., Hovey, E., Livingstone, A., Sawkins, K., Chye, R., Lovell, M.R., Clark, K., Vardy, J., King, M. & On, B.O.T.C.T.G.F.N.-.O.C. 2015, 'Validating self-report and proxy reports of the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire -Chronic for the evaluation of longer-term corticosteroid toxicity', Supportive Care in Cancer.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg Purpose: In brain tumours, brain metastases or advanced cancer, treatment with corticosteroids, side effects can add to symptoms. These are best assessed by patients, complementing clinical assessment. We assessed the feasibility and validity of the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire;8211#Chronic (DSQ-Chronic), patient and caregiver versions. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted, collecting clinician-rated toxicity, performance status, dexamethasone dose and DSQ-Chronic (patient and caregiver versions) at baseline, then 2, 4 and 8 weeks later. Patients had a primary malignant brain tumour, brain metastases, or advanced cancer, Karnofsky Performance Status?40 and predicted survival?8 weeks. Analysis included questionnaire completion rates, frequency and severity of dexamethasone-attributable side effects, agreement between patient and caregiver ratings, comparison with clinician-rated toxicity and correlation with performance status. Results: Sixty-six patients were recruited (mean age 60 years), with their caregivers. Completion of questionnaires was over 90 % for the dyad at baseline but dropped over time, with caregiver completion rates higher at all timepoints. Agreement between patients and proxies was fair to moderate, and while proxies systematically overestimated symptom severity on DSQ-chronic total scores, the bias was less than 10 points. Patient and clinician agreement was higher for more objective symptoms. Conclusion: The DSQ-Chronic is feasible when the patient is relatively well. As capacity to complete the DSQ-Chronic diminishes, caregivers can be proxy-raters. Clinicians capture corticosteroid toxicities, which may not be obvious to the patient. The DSQ-Chronic, patient and caregiver versions, are useful tools to be used with clinician assessment.;Dong, S.T., Costa, D.S.J., Butow, P.N., Lovell, M.R., Agar, M., Velikova, G., Teckle, P., Tong, A., Tebbutt, N.C., Clarke, S.J., van der Hoek, K., King, M.T. & Fayers, P.M. 2015, 'Symptom Clusters in Advanced Cancer Patients: An Empirical Comparison of Statistical Methods and the Impact on Quality of Life', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Context: Symptom clusters in advanced cancer can influence patient outcomes. There is large heterogeneity in the methods used to identify symptom clusters. Objectives: To investigate the consistency of symptom cluster composition in advanced cancer patients using different statistical methodologies for all patients across five primary cancer sites, and to examine which clusters predict functional status, a global assessment of health and global quality of life. Methods: Principal component analysis and exploratory factor analysis (with different rotation and factor selection methods) and hierarchical cluster analysis (with different linkage and similarity measures) were used on a data set of 1562 advanced cancer patients who completed the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30. Results: Four clusters consistently formed for many of the methods and cancer sites: tense-worry-irritable-depressed (emotional cluster), fatigue-pain, nausea-vomiting, and concentration-memory (cognitive cluster). The emotional cluster was a stronger predictor of overall quality of life than the other clusters. Fatigue-pain was a stronger predictor of overall health than the other clusters. The cognitive cluster and fatigue-pain predicted physical functioning, role functioning, and social functioning. Conclusions: The four identified symptom clusters were consistent across statistical methods and cancer types, although there were some noteworthy differences. Statistical derivation of symptom clusters is in need of greater methodological guidance. A psychosocial pathway in the management of symptom clusters may improve quality of life. Biological mechanisms underpinning symptom clusters need to be delineated by future research. A framework for evidence-based screening, assessment, treatment, and follow-up of symptom clusters in advanced cancer is essential.;Agar, M., Beattie, E., Luckett, T., Phillips, J., Luscombe, G., Goodall, S., Mitchell, G., Pond, D., Davidson, P.M. & Chenoweth, L. 2015, 'Pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial of facilitated family case conferencing compared with usual care for improving end of life care and outcomes in nursing home residents with advanced dementia and their families: The IDEAL study protocol', BMC Palliative Care.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 Agar et al. Background: Care for people with advanced dementia requires a palliative approach targeted to the illness trajectory and tailored to individual needs. However, care in nursing homes is often compromised by poor communication and limited staff expertise. This paper reports the protocol for the IDEAL Project, which aims to: 1) compare the efficacy of a facilitated approach to family case conferencing with usual care, 2) provide insights into nursing home- and staff-related processes influencing the implementation and sustainability of case conferencing, and 3) evaluate cost-effectiveness. Design/Methods: A pragmatic parallel cluster randomised controlled trial design will be used. Twenty Australian nursing homes will be randomised to receive either facilitated family case conferencing or usual care. Discussion: The IDEAL Project will make an important contribution to the evidence base for dementia-specific case conferencing in nursing homes by considering processes and contextual factors as well as overall efficacy. Its strengths and weaknesses will both lie in its pragmatic design. Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12612001164886.

Primary carers experience significant levels of distress which impacts on their experience of caregiving, the quality of care received and the community in terms of the increased reliance on healthcare due to the potential development of complicated grief. This paper describes the protocol for testing the efficacy and feasibility of an intervention for primary carers of patients with HGG in order to improve preparedness to care and reduce carer distress. Methods: Randomised controlled trial. The target population is carers of patients with HGG who are undergoing combined chemoradiotherapy. The intervention consists of 4 components: (1) initial telephone assessment of unmet needs of the carer, (2) tailoring of a personalised resource folder, (3) home visit, (4) ongoing monthly telephone contact and support for 12 months. The control arm will receive usual care. Primary hypothesis: This intervention will improve preparedness for caring and reduce carer psychological distress. Secondary hypothesis: This intervention will reduce carer unmet needs. The longer term aim of the intervention is to reduce patient healthcare resource utilisation and, by doing so, reduce costs. Assessments will be obtained at baseline, 8 weeks post intervention, then 4, 6 and 12 months. Participants will also complete a healthcare utilisation checklist and proxy performance status which will be assessed at baseline and monthly. 240 carers will be recruited. The sample size is 180. Multilevel mixed effects regression models will be applied to test the effect of the intervention. Ethics: Ethics approval has been gained from Curtin University and the participating sites. Dissemination: Results will be reported in international peer-reviewed journals.;Dong, S.T., Butow, P.N., Tong, A., Agar, M., Boyle, F., Forster, B.C., Stockler, M. & Lovell, M.R. 2015, 'Patients' experiences and perspectives of multiple concurrent symptoms in advanced cancer: a semi-structured interview study', Supportive Care in Cancer.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg Purpose: Patients with advanced cancer typically experience multiple concurrent symptoms, which have a detrimental impact on patient outcomes. No studies to date have qualitatively explored advanced cancer patients' perceptions of multiple symptoms in oncology and palliative care settings. Understanding the experience of multiple symptoms can inform integrated clinical pathways for treating, assessing and reducing symptom burden. This study aims to describe the beliefs, attitudes and experiences of patients with multiple symptoms in advanced cancer. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 58 advanced cancer patients (23 inpatients and 35 outpatients), recruited purposively from two palliative care centres and two hospital-based oncology departments in Sydney, Australia. Transcripts were analysed thematically. Results: Six major themes were identified: imminence of death and deterioration (impending death, anticipatory fear), overwhelming loss of control (symptom volatility, debilitating exhaustion, demoralisation, isolation), impinging on autonomy and identity (losing independence, refusal to a diminished self, self-advocacy, reluctance to burden others), psychological adaptation (accepting the impossibility of recovery, seeking distractions, maintaining hope, mindfulness, accommodating self-limitations), burden of self-management responsibility (perpetual self-monitoring, ambiguity in self-report, urgency of decision making, optimising management), and valuing security and empowerment (safety in coordinated care, compassionate care, fear of medical abandonment, dependence on social support). Patients transitioning from oncology to palliative care settings were more vulnerable to self-management burden. Conclusion: Multiple symptoms have a profound impact on patients' autonomy, function and psychological state.

But further research is needed to determine the service models that can best deliver optimal outcomes in the most cost-effective way. Model heterogeneity and diversity is needed to address issues that are disease, treatment or symptom specific, and account for other modifying influences such as comorbid illness and lifestyle. Further work is needed to determine the key elements within models of care configured to support cancer survivors that positively influence outcomes, and how these elements can be best delivered across a diverse range of care settings. In the meantime, adopting a needs based approach to care at the individual patient level will ensure that those in most need have access to relevant support and care from specialist palliative care services. Fortunately, current Australian health reforms provide a climate of plasticity and innovation that is conducive to the paradigm shifts required.;Dong, S.T., Butow, P.N., Agar, M., Lovell, M.R., Boyle, F., Stockler, M., Forster, B.C. & Tong, A. 2015, 'Clinicians' Perspectives on Managing Symptom Clusters in Advanced Cancer: A Semi-Structured Interview Study.', J Pain Symptom Manage.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;CONTEXT: Managing \"symptom clusters,\" or multiple concurrent symptoms in patients with advanced cancer remains a clinical challenge. The optimal processes constituting effective management of symptoms clusters remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To describe the attitudes and strategies of clinicians in managing multiple co-occurring symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 clinicians (palliative care physicians [n=10], oncologists [n=6], general practitioners [n=6], nurses [n=12], and allied health providers [n=14]), purposively recruited from two acute hospitals, two palliative care centers, and four community general practices in Sydney, Australia. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis and adapted grounded theory. RESULTS: Six themes were identified: uncertainty in decision making (inadequacy of scientific evidence, relying on experiential knowledge, pressure to optimize care), attunement to patient and family (sensitivity to multiple cues, prioritizing individual preferences, addressing psychosocial and physical interactions, opening \"Pandora's Box\"), deciphering cause to guide intervention (disaggregating symptoms and interactions, flexibility in assessment, curtailing investigative intrusiveness), balancing complexities in medical management (trading off side effects, minimizing mismatched goals, urgency in resolving severe symptoms), fostering hope and empowerment (allaying fear of the unknown, encouraging meaning making, championing patient empowerment, truth telling), and depending on multidisciplinary expertise (maximizing knowledge exchange, sharing management responsibility, contending with hierarchical tensions, isolation and discontinuity of care). CONCLUSION: Management of symptom clusters, as both an art and a science, is currently fraught with uncertainty in decision making.

We set out to identify evidence-based models of palliative care to inform policy reform in Australia. Method. A rapid review of electronic databases and the grey literature was undertaken over an eight week period in April-June 2012. We included policy documents and comparative studies from countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published in English since 2001. Meta-analysis was planned where 1 study met criteria, otherwise, synthesis was narrative using methods described by Popay et al. (2006). Results: Of 1,959 peer-reviewed articles, 23 reported systematic reviews, 9 additional RCTs and 34 non-randomised comparative studies. Variation in the content of models, contexts in which these were implemented and lack of detailed reporting meant that elements of models constituted a more meaningful unit of analysis than models themselves. Case management was the element most consistently reported in models for which comparative studies provided evidence for effectiveness. Essential attributes of population-based palliative care models identified by policy and addressed by more than one element were communication and coordination between providers (including primary care), skill enhancement, and capacity to respond rapidly to individuals' changing needs and preferences over time. Conclusion: Models of palliative care should integrate specialist expertise with primary and community care services and enable transitions across settings, including residential aged care. The increasing complexity of care needs, services, interventions and contextual drivers warrants future research aimed at elucidating the interactions between different components and the roles played by patient, provider and health system factors.

Despite nurses' integral patient care role, little is known about palliative care nurses' capacity to recognise, assess and respond to patients' delirium symptoms. Objective: To explore the experiences, views and practices of inpatient palliative care nurses in delirium recognition and assessment. Settings and participants: 30 nurses from nine Australian specialist palliative care inpatient services. Design and methods: Critical incident technique (CIT) guided a series of semi-structured interviews. Prior to interviews participants were given a vignette of a palliative care inpatient with an unrecognised hypoactive delirium, to prompt their recollection and recounting of a similar clinical incident. Clearly recalled and described incidents were analysed using thematic content analysis. Findings: 20 of 30 participants recalled and described 28 relevant delirium incidents. Two themes and six sub-themes provide a general description of participants' experiences, views and practice in delirium recognition and assessment. Participants experience distress related to caring for patients with delirium and express compassion and empathy for delirious patients. Enhancing their delirium knowledge, strengthening collaborative multidisciplinary team relationships and better communication are important supports. Some participants, usually those in advance practice roles, describe more comprehensive assessment capabilities that incorporate clinical expertise with whole person awareness, yet systematic and structured delirium screening and assessment processes and application of the delirium diagnosis criteria are largely missing. Use of ambiguous terminology to describe delirium symptoms contributes to ineffective practice.

Measuring a person's movement within his or her own environment is a clinically relevant and patient-centered outcome because it measures function in a way that reflects actual and not theoretical participation. Objectives This exploratory study set out to test whether the Life-Space Assessment (LSA) would correlate with other commonly used palliative care outcome measures of function and quality of life. Methods The baseline LSA, Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (AKPS), and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 15-Palliative (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL) scores from two large clinical trials were used to calculate correlation coefficients between the measures. Convergent validity analysis was undertaken by comparing LSA scores between participants with higher (?70) and lower (?60) AKPS scores. Results The LSA was correlated significantly and positively with the AKPS, with a moderate correlation coefficient of 0.54 (P 0.001). There was a significant weak negative correlation between the LSA and the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL, with a small coefficient of -0.22 (P = 0.027), but a strong correlation between the LSA and the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL item related to independent activities of daily living (r = -0.654, P 0.01). A significant difference in the LSA score between participants with higher (?70) and lower (?60) AKPS scores t(97) = -4.35, P 0.001) was found. Conclusion The LSA appears applicable to palliative care populations given the convergent validity and capacity of this instrument to differentiate a person's ability to move through life-space zones by performance status. Further research is required to validate and apply the LSA within community palliative care populations. &&copy;2014 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

However, the mechanisms by which patient education improves pain outcomes are uncertain, as are the optimal delivery, content, timing, frequency, and duration. This review provides best-bet recommendations based on available evidence to guide service managers and clinicians in developing a patient education program. Methods: We used patient-centered care, self-management, coaching, and a behavior change wheel as lenses through which to consider the evidence for elements of patient education most likely to be effective within the context of other strategies for overcoming barriers to cancer pain assessment and management. Results: The evidence suggests that optimal strategies include those that are patient-centered and tailored to individual needs, are embedded within health professional-patient communication and therapeutic relationships, empower patients to self-manage and coordinate their care, and are routinely integrated into standard cancer care. An approach that integrates patient education with processes and systems to ensure implementation of key standards for pain assessment and management and education of health professionals has been shown to be most effective. Conclusion: Patient education is effective in reducing cancer pain and should be standard practice in all settings. For optimal results, patient education should be integrated with other strategies for implementing evidence-based, person-centered care and overcoming barriers at the levels of patient, provider, and health system. &&copy;2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.;Hosie, A., Lobb, E., Agar, M., Davidson, P.M. & Phillips, J. 2014, 'Identifying the barriers and enablers to palliative care nurses' recognition and assessment of delirium symptoms: A qualitative study', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 48, no. 5, pp. 815-830.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Context. Delirium is underrecognized by nurses, including those working in palliative care settings where the syndrome occurs frequently. Identifying contextual factors that support and/or hinder palliative care nurses' delirium recognition and assessment capabilities is crucial, to inform development of clinical practice and systems aimed at improving patients' delirium outcomes. Objectives. The aim of the study was to identify nurses' perceptions of the barriers and enablers to recognizing and assessing delirium symptoms in palliative care inpatient settings. Methods. A series of semistructured interviews, guided by critical incident technique, were conducted with nurses working in Australian palliative care inpatient settings. A hypoactive delirium vignette prompted participants' recall of delirium and identification of the perceived factors (barriers and enablers) that impacted on their delirium recognition and assessment capabilities. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. Results. Thirty participants from nine palliative care services provided insights into the barriers and enablers of delirium recognition and assessment in the inpatient setting that were categorized as patient and family, health professional, and system level factors. Analysis revealed five themes, each reflecting both identified barriers and current and/or potential enablers: 1) value in listening to patients and engaging families, 2) assessment is integrated with care delivery, 3) respecting and integrating nurses' observations, 4) addressing nurses' delirium knowledge needs, and 5) integrating delirium recognition and assessment processes. Conclusion. Supporting the development of palliative care nursing delirium recognition and assessment practice requires attending to a range of barriers and enablers at the patient and family, health professional, and system levels.;Luckett, T., Davidson, P.M., Boyle, F., Liauw, W., Agar, M., Green, A. & Lovell, M. 2014, 'Australian survey of current practice and guideline use in adult cancer pain assessment and management: Perspectives of oncologists', Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology, vol. 10, no. 2, pp. e99-e107.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Aims: Cancer pain continues to be undertreated in up to half of cases, despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines. This study aimed to: (i) identify barriers and facilitators to adult cancer pain assessment and management, as perceived by Australian health professionals, (ii) establish the perceived need for new Australian guidelines and implementation strategy, (iii) identify which guidelines are used, (iv) identify barriers and facilitators to guideline use. This article focuses on the perceptions of responding oncologists. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered online. Invitations were circulated via peak bodies and clinical leaders. Comments were coded independently by two researchers. Results: In all 76 oncologists self-reported high concordance with evidence-based recommendations, except validated pain scales. Perceived barriers to pain management included insufficient non-pharmacological interventions, access to /coordination between services, and time. Only 22 percent of respondents reported using pain guidelines. Perceived barriers to guideline use included lack of access, awareness and any single standard. Respondents were generally supportive of new Australian guidelines and especially an implementation strategy. Conclusion: Barriers to evidence-based practice and guideline use identified by our survey might be addressed via a clinical pathway that gives step-by-step guidance on evidence-based practice along with a framework for evaluation. Particular attention should be paid to promoting use of validated scales, patient education and non-pharmacological interventions, training of an appropriately skilled workforce and improving care coordination. Challenges are discussed. &&copy;2012 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.;Smith, T., Dunford, M., Agar, M., Davidson, P., Jenkins, C. & Ingham, J. 2014, 'Symptom Burden and Distress in Individuals Undergoing Noninvasive Ventilation for Acute Respiratory Failure.', Chest, vol. 146, no. 4_MeetingAbstracts, p. 39A.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;COPD Diagnosis and Evaluation Posters IISESSION TYPE: Original Investigation PosterPRESENTED ON: Wednesday, October 29, 2014 at 01:30 PM - 02:30 PMPURPOSE: Patients with cardiorespiratory disease have a high symptom burden when assessed in inpatient or outpatient settings. Such patients may develop to acute exacerbations, complicated by respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is increasingly used to manage acute respiratory failure due to decompensated cardiorespiratory disease. Little is known about the distress experienced by patients undergoing NIV, including symptom burden and delirium point prevalence. To date, no studies have quantified either of these important clinical endpoints.METHODS: Consecutive consenting, English speaking, cognitively intact patients treated outside ICU with NIV for hypercapnic respiratory failure were recruited. Assessment occurred within 36 hours of starting NIV. Symptom burden over the previous 72 hours was assessed measured using the Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (CMSAS). This scale assesses the peak bothersomeness of 11 physical symptoms (rated 0-4) and frequency of 3 psychological symptoms (rated 0-4). Delirium point prevalence was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU).RESULTS: Fifty participants (64% female, mean age 71.9yrs, SD 13.1) were recruited. Prior to NIV, mean arterial pH was 7.30(SD 0.08) and a mean arterial pCO2 58.1mmHg(SD 11.9). Of these, 38% had obstructive lung disease, 14% had heart failure, 30% had both these conditions. The remainder had other causes of respiratory failure. The most prevalent symptoms were breathlessness(92%), dry mouth(88%) and lack of energy(86%). These were also the most bothersome symptoms. The most frequent psychological symptom was worry(64%). The mean total CMSAS score was 1.60(SD 0.66), with the mean physical symptom score of 1.62(SD 0.63) and the mean psychological score of 1.57(SD1.22).

The increasing burden of chronic disease and focus on person-centred care, necessitates frank discussions of the benefits and burdens of treatment and an understanding of the patients' perspective. We aimed to describe the subjective experience of individuals undergoing NIV for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.METHODS: Face-to-face interviews, analysed using qualitative thematic analysisRESULTS: Thirteen participants were interviewed. Six interrelated themes emerged: A passenger on a journey dominated by chronic illness, Balancing benefits and burdens of NIV, Looking to another chance, Knowing what alleviates my distress, Struggling and suffering, Feeling vulnerable and trusting staff. Participants viewed NIV as a two-edged sword, providing substantial relief from symptoms, but engendering discomfort and burden. No participant would forgo this treatment in the future. While participants sometimes appeared passive, they often had significant insight into what relieved their subjective distress. Participants expressed both a sense of compulsion to accept NIV and gratitude for NIV as it facilitated another chance at life. Many participants described minimal recollection of their acute hospitalisation, and placed a great amount of trust in health care providers.CONCLUSIONS: Participants described balancing benefits and burdens of NIV, with the goal of achieving 'another chance' at life. This goal was highly valued despite their description of their life as one of struggle and suffering. While many knew what might alleviate their distress they often appeared passive, like passengers on a journey dominated by their chronic illness.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Enhanc...;To, T.H.M., Agar, M., Yates, P. & Currow, D.C. 2014, 'Prescribing for nausea in palliative care: A cross-sectional national survey of australian palliative medicine doctors', Journal of Palliative Medicine, vol. 17, no. 9, pp. 1032-1036.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. Background: Nausea can be a debilitating symptom for patients with a life-limiting illness. While addressing reversible components, nonpharmacological strategies and antiemetics are the main therapeutic option. The choice of medication, dose, and route of administration remain highly variable. Objective: The aim of this study was to codify the current clinical approaches and quantify any variation found nationally. Methods: A cross-sectional study utilizing a survey of palliative medicine clinicians examined prescribing preferences for nausea using a clinical vignette. Respondent characteristics, the use of nonpharmacological interventions, first-and second-line antiemetic choices, commencing and maximal dose, and time to review were collected.Results: Responding clinicians were predominantly working in palliative medicine across a range of settings with a 49% response rate (105/213). The main nonpharmacological recommendation was \"small, frequent snacks.\" Metoclopramide was the predominant first-line agent (69%), followed by haloperidol (26%), while second-line haloperidol was the predominant agent (47%), with wide variation in other nominated agents. Respondents favoring metoclopramide as first-line tended to use haloperidol second-line (65%), but not vice versa. Maximal doses for an individual antiemetic varied up to tenfold.Conclusion: For nausea, a commonly encountered symptom in palliative care, clinicians' favored metoclopramide and haloperidol, however, after these choices, there was large variation in antiemetic selection. While most clinicians recommended modifying meal size and frequency, use of other nonpharmacological therapies was limited.;Yamaguchi, T., Kuriya, M., Morita, T., Agar, M., Choi, Y.S., Goh, C., Lingegowda, K.B., Lim, R., Liu, R.K., MacLeod, R., Ocampo, R., Cheng, S.Y., Phungrassami, T., Nguyen, Y.P. & Tsuneto, S. 2014, 'Palliative care development in the Asia-Pacific region: an international survey from the Asia Pacific Hospice Palliative Care Network (APHN).', BMJ Support Palliat Care.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;BACKGROUND: Although palliative care is an important public healthcare issue worldwide, the current situation in the Asia-Pacific region has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: This survey aimed to clarify the current status of palliative care in the Asia-Pacific region. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to a representative physician of each member country/region of the Asia Pacific Hospice Palliative Care Network (APHN). The questionnaire examined palliative care service provision, information regarding physician certification in palliative care, the availability of essential drugs for palliative care listed by the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care (IAHPC) and the regulation of opioid-prescribing practice. RESULTS: Of the 14 member countries/regions of the APHN, 12 (86%) responded. Some form of specialist palliative care services had developed in all the responding countries/regions. Eight member countries/regions had physician certifications for palliative care. Most essential drugs for palliative care listed by the IAHPC were available, whereas hydromorphone, oxycodone and transmucosal fentanyl were unavailable in most countries/regions. Six member countries/regions required permission to prescribe and receive opioids. CONCLUSIONS: The development of palliative care is in different stages across the surveyed countries/regions in the Asia-Pacific region. Data from this survey can be used as baseline data for monitoring the development of palliative care in this region.;Bush, S.H., Leonard, M.M., Agar, M., Spiller, J.A., Hosie, A., Wright, D.K., Meagher, D.J., Currow, D.C., Bruera, E. & Lawlor, P.G. 2014, 'End-of-life delirium: Issues regarding recognition, optimal management, and the role of sedation in the dying phase', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 48, no. 2, pp. 215-230.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Context In end-of-life care, delirium is often not recognized and poses unique management challenges, especially in the case of refractory delirium in the terminal phase. Objectives To review delirium in the terminal phase context, specifically in relation to recognition issues, the decision-making processes and management strategies regarding its reversibility, the potential refractoriness of delirium to symptomatic treatment, and the role of sedation in refractory delirium. Methods We combined multidisciplinary input from delirium researchers and knowledge users at an international delirium study planning meeting and relevant electronic database literature searches (Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL) to inform this narrative review. Results The overall management strategy for delirium at the end of life is directed by the patient's prognosis in association with the patient's goals of care. As symptoms of delirium are often refractory in the terminal phase, especially in the case of agitated delirium, the judicious use of palliative sedation is frequently required. However, there remains a lack of high-level evidence for the management of delirium in the terminal phase, including the role of antipsychotics and optimal sedation strategies. For the family and health-care staff, clear communication, education, and emotional support are vital components to assist with decision making and direct the treatment care plan. Conclusion Further research on the effectiveness of delirium management strategies in the terminal phase for patients and their families is required. Further validation of assessment tools for diagnostic screening and severity measurement is needed in this patient population. &&copy;2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

Objectives To review three major areas that create diagnostic and classification challenges in relation to delirium in palliative care: subsyndromal delirium (SSD), delirium in the context of comorbid dementia, and classification of psychomotor subtypes, and to identify knowledge gaps and research priorities in relation to these three areas of focus. Methods We combined multidisciplinary input from delirium researchers and knowledge users at an international delirium study planning meeting and relevant PubMed literature searches as the knowledge synthesis strategy in this review. Results We identified six (SSD), 33 (dementia), and 44 (psychomotor subtypes) articles of relevance in relation to the focus of our review. Recent literature data highlight the frequency and impact of SSD, the relevance of comorbid dementia, and the propensity for a hypoactive presentation of delirium in the palliative population. The differential diagnoses to consider are wide and include pain, fatigue, mood disturbance, psychoactive medication effects, and other causes for altered consciousness. Conclusion Challenges in the diagnosis and classification of delirium in people with advanced disease are compounded by the generalized disturbance of central nervous system function that occurs in the seriously ill, often with comorbid illness, including dementia. Further research is needed to delineate the pathophysiological and clinical associations of these presentations and thus inform therapeutic strategies. The expanding aged population and growing focus on dementia care in palliative care highlight the need to conduct this research. &&copy;2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

Nonopioids were recommended for mild pain, with the addition of mild opioids for moderate pain and strong opioids for severe pain. Here, we review the evidence for the use of nonopioid analgesic agents in patients with cancer and describe the mode of action of the main drug classes. Evidence supports the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as acetaminophen/paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for mild cancer pain. Adding an NSAID to an opioid for stronger cancer pain is efficacious, but the risk of long-term adverse effects has not been quantified. There is limited evidence to support using acetaminophen with stronger opioids. Corticosteroids have a specific role in spinal cord compression and brain metastases, where improved analgesia is a secondary benefit. There is limited evidence for adding corticosteroids to stronger opioids when pain control is the primary objective. Systematic reviews suggest a role for antidepressant and anticonvulsant medications for neuropathic pain, but there are methodologic issues with the available studies. Bisphosphonates improve pain in patients with bony metastases in some tumor types. Denosumab may delay worsening of pain compared with bisphosphonates. Larger studies of longer duration are required to address outstanding questions concerning the use of nonopioid analgesia for stronger cancer pain. &&copy;2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.;Leonard, M.M., Nekolaichuk, C., Meagher, D.J., Barnes, C., Gaudreau, J.D., Watanabe, S., Agar, M., Bush, S.H. & Lawlor, P.G. 2014, 'Practical assessment of delirium in palliative care', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 48, no. 2, pp. 176-190.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Context Delirium is a common, distressing neuropsychiatric complication for patients in palliative care settings, where the need to minimize burden yet accurately assess delirium is hugely challenging. Objectives This review focused on the optimal clinical and research application of delirium assessment tools and methods in palliative care settings. Methods In addition to multidisciplinary input from delirium researchers and other relevant stakeholders at an international meeting, we searched PubMed (1990-2012) and relevant reference lists to identify delirium assessment tools used either exclusively or partly in the context of palliative care. Results Of the 26 delirium scales identified, we selected six for in-depth review: three screening tools, two severity measures, and one research tool for neuropsychological assessment of delirium. These tools differed regarding intended use, ease of use, training requirements, psychometric properties, and validation in or suitability for palliative care populations. The Nursing Delirium Screening Scale, Single Question in Delirium, or Confusion Assessment Method, ideally with a brief attention test, can effectively screen for delirium. Favoring inclusivity, use of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria gives the best results for delirium diagnosis. The Revised Delirium Rating Scale and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale are the best available options for monitoring severity, and the Cognitive Test for Delirium provides detailed neuropsychological assessment for research purposes. Conclusion Given the unique characteristics of patients in palliative care settings, further contextually sensitive studies of delirium assessment are required in this population. &&copy;2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

The extent to which formal management guidelines exist or are adaptable to palliative care is unclear. Objectives This review aims to 1) source published delirium management guidelines with potential relevance to palliative care settings, 2) discuss the process of guideline development, 3) appraise their clinical utility, and 4) outline the processes of their implementation and evaluation and make recommendations for future guideline development. Methods We searched PubMed (1990-2013), Scopus, U.S. National Guideline Clearinghouse, Google, and relevant reference lists to identify published guidelines for the management of delirium. This was supplemented with multidisciplinary input from delirium researchers and other relevant stakeholders at an international delirium study planning meeting. Results There is a paucity of high-level evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in the management of delirium in palliative care. However, multiple delirium guidelines for clinical practice have been developed, with recommendations derived from \"expert opinion\" for areas where research evidence is lacking. In addition to their potential benefits, limitations of clinical guidelines warrant consideration. Guidelines should be appraised and then adapted for use in a particular setting before implementation. Further research is needed on the evaluation of guidelines, as disseminated and implemented in a clinical setting, focusing on measurable outcomes in addition to their impact on quality of care. Conclusion Delirium clinical guidelines are available but the level of evidence is limited. More robust evidence is required for future guideline development. &&copy;2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Objectives The aim was to formulate an analytical framework for further research on delirium in palliative care settings, prioritize the associated research questions, discuss the inherent methodological challenges associated with relevant studies, and outline the next steps in a program of delirium research. Methods We combined multidisciplinary input from delirium researchers and knowledge users at an international delirium study planning meeting, relevant literature searches, focused input of epidemiologic expertise, and a meeting participant and coauthor survey to formulate a conceptual research framework and prioritize research questions. Results Our proposed framework incorporates three main groups of research questions: the first was predominantly epidemiologic, such as delirium occurrence rates, risk factor evaluation, screening, and diagnosis, the second covers pragmatic management questions, and the third relates to the development of predictive models for delirium outcomes. Based on aggregated survey responses to each research question or domain, the combined modal ratings of \"very\" or \"extremely\" important confirmed their priority. Conclusion Using an analytical framework to represent the full clinical care pathway of delirium in palliative care settings, we identified multiple knowledge gaps in relation to the occurrence rates, assessment, management, and outcome prediction of delirium in this population. The knowledge synthesis generated from adequately powered, multicenter studies to answer the framework's research questions will inform decision making and policy development regarding delirium detection and management and thus help to achieve better outcomes for patients in palliative care settings. &&copy;2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

Context. Advanced cancer patients typically experience multiple symptoms, which may influence patient outcomes synergistically. The composition of these symptom clusters (SCs) differs depending on various clinical variables and the timing and method of their assessment. Objectives. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the composition, longitudinal stability, and consistency across methodologies of common SCs, as well as their common predictors and outcomes. Methods. A search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO was conducted using variants of symptom clusters, cancer, and palliative care. Results. Thirty-three articles were identified and reviewed. Many SCs were identified, with four common groupings being anxiety-depression, nausea-vomiting, nausea-appetite loss, and fatigue-dyspnea-drowsiness-pain. SCs in most cases were not stable longitudinally. The various statistical methods used (most commonly principal component analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis) tended to reveal different SCs. Different measurement tools were used in different studies, each containing a different array of symptoms. The predictors and outcomes of SCs were also inconsistent across studies. No studies of patient experiences of SCs were identified. Conclusion. Although the articles reviewed revealed four groups of symptoms that tended to cluster, there is limited consistency in the way in which SCs and variables associated with them are identified. This is largely due to a lack of agreement about a robust, clinically relevant definition of SCs. Future research should focus on patients' subjective experience of SCs to inform a clinically relevant definition of SCs and how they are managed over time.;Clark, K., Lam, L., Currow, D.C. & Agar, M. 2014, 'A prospective study to investigate contributory factors that lead to constipation in palliative care patients', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 47, no. 6, pp. e1-e4.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Bush, S.H., Kanji, S., Pereira, J.L., Davis, D.H.J., Currow, D.C., Meagher, D.J., Rabheru, K., Wright, D.K., Bruera, E., Agar, M., Hartwick, M., Gagnon, P.R., Gagnon, B., Breitbart, W., Regnier, L. & Lawlor, P.G. 2014, 'Treating an established episode of delirium in palliative care: Expert opinion and review of the current evidence base with recommendations for future development', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 48, no. 2, pp. 231-248.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Context Delirium is a highly prevalent complication in patients in palliative care settings, especially in the end-of-life context. Objectives To review the current evidence base for treating episodes of delirium in palliative care settings and propose a framework for future development. Methods We combined multidisciplinary input from delirium researchers and other purposely selected stakeholders at an international delirium study planning meeting. This was supplemented by a literature search of multiple databases and relevant reference lists to identify studies regarding therapeutic interventions for delirium. Results The context of delirium management in palliative care is highly variable. The standard management of a delirium episode includes the investigation of precipitating and aggravating factors followed by symptomatic treatment with drug therapy. However, the intensity of this management depends on illness trajectory and goals of care in addition to the local availability of both investigative modalities and therapeutic interventions. Pharmacologically, haloperidol remains the practice standard by consensus for symptomatic control. Dosing schedules are derived from expert opinion and various clinical practice guidelines as evidence-based data from palliative care settings are limited. The commonly used pharmacologic interventions for delirium in this population warrant evaluation in clinical trials to examine dosing and titration regimens, different routes of administration, and safety and efficacy compared with placebo. Conclusion Delirium treatment is multidimensional and includes the identification of precipitating and aggravating factors. For symptomatic management, haloperidol remains the practice standard. Further high-quality collaborative research investigating the appropriate treatment of this complex syndrome is needed. &&copy;2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

Objectives Based on deliberations at the Studies to Understand Delirium in Palliative Care Settings (SUNDIPS) meeting and an associated literature review, this article discusses ethical issues central to the conduct of research on delirious PC patients. Methods Together with an analysis of the ethical deliberations at the SUNDIPS meeting, we conducted a narrative literature review by key words searching of relevant databases and a subsequent hand search of initially identified articles. We also reviewed statements of relevance to delirium research in major national and international ethics guidelines. Results Key issues identified include the inclusion of PC patients in delirium research, capacity determination, and the mandate to respect patient autonomy and ensure maintenance of patient dignity. Proposed solutions include designing informed consent statements that are clear, concise, and free of complex phraseology, use of concise, yet accurate, capacity assessment instruments with a minimally burdensome schedule, and use of PC friendly consent models, such as facilitated, deferred, experienced, advance, and proxy models. Conclusion Delirium research in PC patients must meet the common standards for such research in any setting. Certain features unique to PC establish a need for extra diligence in meeting these standards and the employment of assessments, consent procedures, and patient-family interactions that are clearly grounded on the tenets of PC. &&copy;2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

Background: Delirium is a common and serious problem among acutely unwell persons. Alhough linked to higher rates of mortality, institutionalisation and dementia, it remains underdiagnosed. Careful consideration of its phenomenology is warranted to improve detection and therefore mitigate some of its clinical impact. The publication of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5) provides an opportunity to examine the constructs underlying delirium as a clinical entity.Discussion: Altered consciousness has been regarded as a core feature of delirium, the fact that consciousness itself should be physiologically disrupted due to acute illness attests to its clinical urgency. DSM-5 now operationalises 'consciousness' as 'changes in attention'. It should be recognised that attention relates to content of consciousness, but arousal corresponds to level of consciousness. Reduced arousal is also associated with adverse outcomes. Attention and arousal are hierarchically related, level of arousal must be sufficient before attention can be reasonably tested.Summary: Our conceptualisation of delirium must extend beyond what can be assessed through cognitive testing (attention) and accept that altered arousal is fundamental. Understanding the DSM-5 criteria explicitly in this way offers the most inclusive and clinically safe interpretation.;Dong, S., Butow, P., Tong, A., Lovell, M. & Agar, M. 2014, '\"Finding the Balance Between Art and Science\": Healthcare Providers' Perspectives on Multiple Symptoms in Advanced Cancer', PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY, vol. 23, pp. 223-224.;Luckett, T., Davidson, P.M., Lam, L., Phillips, J., Currow, D.C. & Agar, M. 2013, 'Do community specialist palliative care services that provide home nursing increase rates of home death for people with life-limiting illnesses? A systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 45, no. 2, pp. 279-297.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Context: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that community specialist palliative care services (SPCSs) can avoid hospitalizations and enable home deaths. But more information is needed regarding the relative efficacies of different models. Family caregivers highlight home nursing as the most important service, but it is also likely the most costly. Objectives: To establish whether community SPCSs offering home nursing increase rates of home death compared with other models. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, AMED, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CENTRAL on March 2 and 3, 2011. To be eligible, articles had to be published in English-language peer-reviewed journals and report original research comparing the effect on home deaths of SPCSs providing home nursing vs. any alternative. Study quality was independently rated using Cochrane grades. Maximum likelihood estimation of heterogeneity was used to establish the method for meta-analysis (fixed or random effects). Potential biases were assessed. Results: Of 1492 articles screened, 10 articles were found eligible, reporting nine studies that yielded data for 10 comparisons. Study quality was high in two cases, moderate in three and low in four. Meta-analysis indicated a significant effect for SPCSs with home nursing (odds ratio 4.45, 95% CI 3.24-6.11, P 0.001). However, the high-quality studies found no effect (odds ratio 1.40, 95% CI 0.97-2.02, P = 0.071). Bias was minimal. Conclusion: A meta-analysis found evidence to be inconclusive that community SPCSs that offer home nursing increase home deaths without compromising symptoms or increasing costs. But a compelling trend warrants further confirmatory studies. Future trials should compare the relative efficacy of different models and intensities of SPCSs. &&copy;2013 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.;Hosie, A., Davidson, P.M., Agar, M., Sanderson, C.R. & Phillips, J. 2013, 'Delirium prevalence, incidence, and implications for screening in specialist palliative care inpatient settings: A systematic review', Palliative Medicine, vol. 27, no. 6, pp. 486-498.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: Delirium is a serious neuropsychiatric syndrome frequently experienced by palliative care inpatients. This syndrome is under-recognized by clinicians. While screening increases recognition, it is not a routine practice. Aim and design: This systematic review aims to examine methods, quality, and results of delirium prevalence and incidence studies in palliative care inpatient populations and discuss implications for delirium screening. Data sources: A systematic search of the literature identified prospective studies reporting on delirium prevalence and/or incidence in inpatient palliative care adult populations from 1980 to 2012. Papers not in English or those reporting the occurrence of symptoms not specifically identified as delirium were excluded. Results: Of the eight included studies, the majority (98.9%) involved participants (1079) with advanced cancer. Eight different screening and assessment tools were used. Delirium incidence ranged from 3% to 45%, while delirium prevalence varied, with a range of: 13.3%-42.3% at admission, 26%-62% during admission, and increasing to 58.8%-88% in the weeks or hours preceding death. Studies that used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fourth Edition reported higher prevalence (42%-88%) and incidence (40.2%- 45%), while incidence rates were higher in studies that screened participants at least daily (32.8%-45%). Hypoactive delirium was the most prevalent delirium subtype (68%-86% of cases). Conclusion: The prevalence and incidence of delirium in palliative care inpatient settings supports the need for screening. However, there is limited consensus on assessment measures or knowledge of implications of delirium screening for inpatients and families. Further research is required to develop standardized methods of delirium screening, assessment, and management that are acceptable to inpatients and families. &&copy;2012 The Author.;Phillips, J.L., West, P.A., Davidson, P.M. & Agar, M. 2013, 'Does case conferencing for people with advanced dementia living in nursing homes improve care outcomes: Evidence from an integrative review?', International Journal of Nursing Studies, vol. 50, no. 8, pp. 1122-1135.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Objective: This integrative review aimed to appraise the evidence for case conferencing as an intervention to improve palliative care outcomes for older people living with advanced dementia in nursing homes. Design: An integrative review of English language citations from CINHAL, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO and CareSearch using a palliative care filter was undertaken. Two reviewers screened 238 titles to find 77 relevant articles which were reviewed in detail to identify nine studies that addressed the specific review questions. The analysis process allowed study characteristics, process and outcome measures along with implementation barriers and facilitators to be identified and the results synthesised. Results: The highest level of evidence (Level II) was generated by two randomised controlled case conferencing trials which demonstrated enhance medication management for people with dementia living in a nursing home. Several pre-post test studies suggest that case conferencing enhances palliative symptom management and care outcomes in nursing homes. Qualitative evidence suggests that case conferencing is feasible and worthwhile if the identified barriers are addressed and the facilitators optimised. Conclusions: Case conferencing provides opportunities to improve care palliative care outcomes for older people with dementia by engaging family and all relevant internal and external health providers in prospective care planning. More evidence is needed to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of case conferencing as a strategy for improving care outcomes for older people living with advanced dementia in nursing homes. The evidence generated by this integrative review will be of interest to policy makers, aged care organisations and clinicians alike, especially as services endeavour to meet the increasingly complex care needs of older people admitted to nursing homes with advanced dementia, and the needs of their families. &&copy;2012 Elsevier Ltd.;Lovell, M., Agar, M., Luckett, T., Davidson, P.M., Green, A. & Clayton, J. 2013, 'Australian survey of current practice and guideline use in adult cancer pain assessment and management: Perspectives of palliative care physicians', Journal of Palliative Medicine, vol. 16, no. 11, pp. 1403-1409.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: Cancer pain continues to be undertreated, despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines. The Australian National Pain Strategy identified establishment of systems and guidelines to adequately manage cancer pain as a high priority. Objectives: This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to adult cancer pain assessment and management as perceived by Australian health professionals, establish the perceived need for new Australian guidelines and implementation strategies, identify which guidelines are used, and identify barriers and facilitators to guideine use. This article focuses on the perceptions of responding palliative care physicians. Design: A cross-sectional survey was administered online. Participants: Invitations were circulated via peak bodies and clinical leaders. Comments were coded independently by two researchers. Results: Ninety-two palliative care physicians responded to the survey, 39% of the national total. The majority reported barriers to pain management, including insufficient access to nonpharmacologic interventions, poor coordination between services, and management challenges posed by comorbidities. Forty-five percent reported using pain guidelines, most commonly the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines - Palliative Care. Respondents were largely supportive of the development of new Australian guidelines and implementation strategies, in particular any offering advice on specific cases of cancer pain (e.g., neuropathic), patient self-management resources, assessment of patient priorities, and disciplinary roles. Conclusion: Barriers to evidence-based practice identified by our survey might be addressed via strategies to support decision making and coordination of care (e.g., a clinical pathway). Particular attention should be paid to promoting access to nonpharmacologic interventions and patient education, and improving referral and care coordination. &&copy;Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.;Crawford, G.B., Meera Agar, M., Quinn, S.J., Phillips, J., Litster, C., Michael, N., Doogue, M., Rowett, D. & Currow, D.C. 2013, 'Pharmacovigilance in hospice/palliative care: Net effect of haloperidol for delirium', Journal of Palliative Medicine, vol. 16, no. 11, pp. 1335-1341.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Introduction: Prescribing practice in hospice/palliative care is largely extrapolated from other areas of clinical practice, with few studies of net medication effects (benefits and harms) in hospice/palliative care to guide prescribing decisions. Hospice/palliative care patients differ in multiple ways from better studied participant groups, hence the applicability of studies in other participant groups is uncertain. Haloperidol, a butyrophenone derivative and dopamine antagonist, is commonly prescribed for nausea, vomiting, and delirium in hospice/palliative care. Its frequent use in delirium occurs despite little evidence of the effect of antipsychotics on the untreated course of delirium. The aim of this study was to examine the immediate and short-term clinical benefits and harms of haloperidol for delirium in hospice/palliative care patients. Method: A consecutive cohort of participants from 14 centers across four countries who had haloperidol commenced for delirium were recruited. Data were collected at three time points: baseline, 48 hours (clinical benefits), and day 10 (clinical harms). Investigators were also able to report clinical harms at any time up to 14 days after it was commenced. Results: Of the 119 participants included, the average dose was 2.1 mg per 24 hours, 42 of 106 (35.2%) reported benefit at 48 hours. Harm was reported in 14 of 119 (12%) at 10 days, the most frequent being somnolence (n=11) and urinary retention (n=6). Seven participants had their medication ceased due to harms (2 for somnolence and 2 for rigidity). Approximately half (55/119) were still being treated with haloperidol after 10 days. Conclusion: Overall, 1 in 3 participants gained net clinical benefit at 10 days. &&copy;Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.;Breaden, K., Phillips, J., Agar, M., Grbich, C., Abernethy, A.P. & Currow, D.C. 2013, 'The clinical and social dimensions of prescribing palliative home oxygen for refractory dyspnea', Journal of Palliative Medicine, vol. 16, no. 3, pp. 268-273.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: Chronic breathlessness is a significant problem in palliative care and oxygen is often prescribed in an attempt to ameliorate it. Often, this prescription falls outside the current funding guidelines for long-term home oxygen use. The aim of this qualitative study was to understand the factors that most influence Australian specialist palliative care nurses' initiation of home oxygen for their patients. Methods: A series of focus groups were held across three states in Australia in 2011 involving specialist palliative care nurses. The invitation to the nurses was sent by e-mail through their national association. Recorded and transcribed data were coded for themes and subthemes. A summary, which included quotes, was provided to participants to confirm. Results: Fifty-one experienced palliative care nurses participated in seven focus groups held in three capital cities. Two major themes were identified: 1) logistic/health service issues (not reported in this paper as specific to the Australian context) involving the local context of prescribing and, 2) clinical care issues that involved assessing the patient's need for home oxygen and ongoing monitoring concerns. Palliative care nurses involved in initiating or prescribing oxygen often reported using oxygen as a second-line treatment after other interventions had been trialed and these had not provided sufficient symptomatic benefit. Safety issues were a universal concern and a person living alone did not emerge as a specific issue among the nurses interviewed. Conclusion: The role of oxygen is currently seen as a second-line therapy in refractory dyspnea by specialist palliative care nurses. &&copy;Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.;McCaffrey, N., Agar, M., Harlum, J., Karnon, J., Currow, D. & Eckermann, S. 2013, 'Is home-based palliative care cost-effective? An economic evaluation of the palliative care extended packages at home (PEACH) pilot', BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care, vol. 3, no. 4, pp. 431-435.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a home-based palliative care model relative to usual care in expediting discharge or enabling patients to remain at home. Design: Economic evaluation of a pilot randomised controlled trial with 28 days follow-up. Methods: Mean costs and effectiveness were calculated for the Palliative Care Extended Packages at Home (PEACH) and usual care arms including: days at home, place of death, PEACH intervention costs, specialist palliative care service use, acute hospital and palliative care unit inpatient stays, and outpatient visits. Results: PEACH mean intervention costs per patient ($3489) were largely offset by lower mean inpatient care costs ($2450) and in this arm, participants were at home for one additional day on average. Consequently, PEACH is cost-effective relative to usual care when the threshold value for one extra day at home exceeds $1068, or $2547 if only within-study days of hospital admission are costed. All estimates are high uncertainty. Conclusions: The results of this small pilot study point to the potential of PEACH as a cost-effective end-of-life care model relative to usual care. Findings support the feasibility of conducting a definitive, fully powered study with longer followup and comprehensive economic evaluation.;Nikles, J., Mitchell, G.K., Hardy, J., Agar, M., Senior, H., Carmont, S.A., Schluter, P.J., Good, P., Vora, R. & Currow, D. 2013, 'Do pilocarpine drops help dry mouth in palliative care patients: A protocol for an aggregated series of n-of-1 trials', BMC Palliative Care, vol. 12, no. 1.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Background: It is estimated that 39,000 Australians die from malignant disease yearly. Of these, 60% to 88% of advanced cancer patients suffer xerostomia, the subjective feeling of mouth dryness. Xerostomia has significant physical, social and psychological consequences which compromise function and quality of life. Pilocarpine is one treatment for xerostomia. Most studies have shown some variation in individual response to pilocarpine, in terms of dose used, and timing and extent of response.We will determine a population estimate of the efficacy of pilocarpine drops (6 mg) three times daily compared to placebo in relieving dry mouth in palliative care (PC) patients. A secondary aim is to assess individual patients' response to pilocarpine and provide reports detailing individual response to patients and their treating clinician. Methods/Design. Aggregated n-of-1 trials (3 cycle, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials using standardized measures of effect). Individual trials will identify which patients respond to the medication. To produce a population estimate of a treatment effect, the results of all cycles will be aggregated. Discussion. Managing dry mouth with treatment supported by the best possible evidence will improve functional status of patients, and improve quality of life for patients and carers. Using n-of-1 trials will accelerate the rate of accumulation of high-grade evidence to support clinical therapies used in PC. Trial registration.

The European Delirium Association (EDA) conducted a survey of its members and other interested parties on various aspects of delirium care. The invitation to participate in the online survey was distributed among the EDA membership. The survey covered assessment, treatment of hyperactive and hypoactive delirium, and organizational management. A total of 200 responses were collected (United Kingdom 28.6%, Netherlands 25.3%, Italy 15%, Switzerland 9.7%, Germany 7.1%, Spain 3.8%, Portugal 2.5%, Ireland 2.5%, Sweden 0.6%, Denmark 0.6%, Austria 0.6%, and others 3.2%). Most of the responders were doctors (80%), working in geriatrics (45%) or internal medicine (14%). Ninety-two per cent of the responders assessed patients for delirium daily. The most commonly used assessment tools were the Confusion Assessment Method (52%) and the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (30%). The first-line choice in the management of hyperactive delirium was a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches (61%). Conversely, non-pharmacological management was the first-line choice in hypoactive delirium (67%). Delirium awareness (34%), knowledge (33%), and lack of education (13%) were the most commonly reported barriers to improving the detection of delirium. Interestingly, 63% of the responders referred patients after an episode of delirium to a follow-up clinic. This is the first systematic survey involving an international group of specialists in delirium. Several areas of lack of consensus were found. These results emphasise the importance of further research to improve care of this major unmet medical need.;Hardy, J., Quinn, S., Fazekas, B., Agar, M. & Currow, D. 2013, 'Can the LANSS scale be used to classify pain in chronic cancer pain trials?', Supportive Care in Cancer, vol. 21, no. 12, pp. 3387-3391.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Purpose: The Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) scale was developed to differentiate pain of predominantly neuropathic or nociceptive origin. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LANSS scale was an appropriate tool to classify pain in a trial of patients with advanced cancer and chronic refractory pain. Methods: Clinician assessment of pain type (neuropathic or nociceptive) was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of LANSS scores in 112 trial participants. Those classified as \"mixed\" or of uncertain aetiology were excluded. We undertook several analyses in an attempt to improve the LANSS scale and better diagnose pain type for our specific dataset. Results: There was strong association between the LANSS score and a diagnosis of neuropathic versus nociceptive pain, p 0.001. When the clinical assessment was compared with the LANSS scale, the overall accuracy was 94 % (79/84). The 5 false negatives and no false positives resulted in a sensitivity of 0.86 (0.70, 0.95), specificity of 1 (0.93, 1), positive predictive value of 1 (0.88, 1) and negative predictive value of 0.91 (0.80, 0.97). The negative likelihood ratio was 0.14 (0, 0.32). The scale had good discriminant and construct validity. Reliability was assessed via internal consistency with Cronbach's? = 0.76, similar to that of the original validation study (? = 0.74). None of the new scales developed was better at differentiating pain type. Conclusions: The LANSS scale predicted well for pain type in a cancer population and is a useful tool for classifying pain in cancer pain trials. &&copy;2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;Agar, M., Ko, D.N., Sheehan, C., Chapman, M. & Currow, D.C. 2013, 'Informed consent in palliative care clinical trials: Challenging but possible', Journal of Palliative Medicine, vol. 16, no. 5, pp. 485-491.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Obtaining informed consent is a key protection that should be afforded universally to people using health services and the basis around which any participation in clinical trials is built. Randomized controlled effectiveness studies are necessary to answer key questions in hospice and palliative care, in order to help systematically improve the quality of care. In order to be properly generalizable, such trials need to have broad inclusion criteria to reflect the population most likely to be affected by the condition. The inclusion of patients who are seriously ill, and therefore potentially vulnerable, requires careful exploration of ethical and legal principles that underpin informed consent. Specific challenges in obtaining informed consent for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in clinically unstable populations such as hospice and palliative care include higher rates of people with impaired cognitive capacity as well as interventional studies in clinical situations which may present as a sudden change in condition. None of these challenges is unique to hospice and palliative care research, but the combination and frequency with which they are encountered require systematic and considered solutions. This article outlines five different ethically valid consent approaches and discusses their applicability to hospice and palliative care research trials. These include: consent by the patient (at the time of enrolment, in advance of the study, or delayed until after the study has commenced), a proxy (or legally authorised representative), or a consent waiver. Increased use of the less traditional modes of informed consent may lead to greater participation rates in hospice and palliative care trials, thereby improving the evidence base more rapidly in part by better reflecting the population served and hence improving generalizability. &&copy;Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.;Senior, H.E.J., Mitchell, G.K., Nikles, J., Carmont, S.A., Schluter, P.J., Currow, D.C., Vora, R., Yelland, M.J., Agar, M., Good, P.D. & Hardy, J.R. 2013, 'Using aggregated single patient (N-of-1) trials to determine the effectiveness of psychostimulants to reduce fatigue in advanced cancer patients: A rationale and protocol', BMC Palliative Care, vol. 12, no. 1.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Background: It is estimated that 29% of deaths in Australia are caused by malignant disease each year and can be expected to increase with population ageing. In advanced cancer, the prevalence of fatigue is high at 70-90%, and can be related to the disease and/or the treatment. The negative impact of fatigue on function (physical, mental, social and spiritual) and quality of life is substantial for many palliative patients as well as their families/carers. Method/design. This paper describes the design of single patient trials (n-of-1 s or SPTs) of a psychostimulant, methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH) (5 mg bd), compared to placebo as a treatment for fatigue, with a population estimate of the benefit by the aggregation of multiple SPTs. Forty patients who have advanced cancer will be enrolled through specialist palliative care services in Australia. Patients will complete up to 3 cycles of treatment. Each cycle is 6 days long and has 3 days treatment and 3 days placebo. The order of treatment and placebo is randomly allocated for each cycle. The primary outcome is a reduction in fatigue severity as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue subscale (FACIT-F). Secondary outcomes include adverse events, quality of life, additional fatigue assessments, depression and Australian Karnovsky Performance Scale. Discussion. This study will provide high-level evidence using a novel methodological approach about the effectiveness of psychostimulants for cancer-related fatigue. If effective, the findings will guide clinical practice in reducing this prevalent condition to improve function and quality of life. Trial registration.

Once registered, prescription is at clinicians' discretion. Off-label use is beyond the registered use. While off-label prescribing may, at times, be appropriate, efficacy and toxicity data are often lacking. Aim: The aim of this study was to document off-label use policies (including disclosure and consent) in Australian palliative care units and current practices by palliative care clinicians. Design: A national, cross-sectional survey was conducted online following an invitation letter. The survey asked clinicians their most frequent off-label medication/indication dyads and unit policies. Dyads were classified into unregistered, off-label and on-label, and for the latter, whether medications were nationally subsidised. Setting/participants: All Australian palliative medicine Fellows and advanced trainees. Results: Overall, 105 clinicians responded (53% response rate). The majority did not have policies on off-label medications, and documented consent rarely. In all, 236 medication/indication dyads for 36 medications were noted: 45 dyads (19%) were for two unregistered medications, 118 dyads (50%) were for 26 off-label medications and 73 dyads (31%) were for 12 on-label medications. Conclusions: Off-label prescribing with its clinical, legal and ethical implications is common yet poorly recognised by clinicians. A distinction needs to be made between where quality evidence exists but registration has not been updated by the pharmaceutical sponsor and the evidence has not been generated. Further research is required to quantify any iatrogenic harm from off-label prescribing in palliative care. &&copy;The Author(s) 2012.;Connell, T., Fernandez, R.S., Tran, D., Griffiths, R., Harlum, J. & Agar, M. 2013, 'Quality of life of community-based palliative care clients and their caregivers', Palliative & supportive care, vol. 11, no. 4, pp. 323-330.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate health-related quality of life of palliative care (PC) clients and their caregivers, at baseline and follow-up, following a referral to a community PC service. METHOD: Quality of life of clients and their caregivers was respectively measured using the McGill Quality of Life instrument (MQoL) and the Caregiver Quality of Life Cancer Index (CQoLC) instruments. Participants were recruited from June 8 to October 27, 2006. This study was undertaken in one zone of an Area Health Service in New South Wales, which has a diverse socioeconomic population. The zone covers an area of 6237 km2 and is divided into five sectors, each with a PC service, all of which participated in this study. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 49 clients and 43 caregivers at baseline, and 22 clients and 12 caregivers at 8 week follow-up. Twenty-one participants died and six moved out of the area during the study. At baseline, clients reported a low mean score for physical symptoms (3.3 &&plusmn;1.9) and a high score for support (8.7 &&plusmn;1.0). Caregivers scored a total CQoLC of 63.9 &&plusmn;21.4 and clients had a total QOL of 6.1 &&plusmn;1.3. At follow up, matched data for 22 clients and 13 caregivers demonstrated no statistical differences in quality of life.

Opioids can reduce the intensity of chronic refractory breathlessness and an anxiolytic may be of benefit. This pilot aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of conducting a phase III study on the intensity of breathlessness by adding regular benzodiazepine to low-dose opioid. Methods: This is a single site, open label phase II study of the addition of regular clonazepam 0.5 mg nocte orally to KapanolR 10 mg (sustained release morphine sulphate) orally mane together with docusate/sennosides in people with modified Medical Research Council Scale?2. Breathlessness intensity on day four was the efficacy outcome. Participants could extend for another 10 days if they achieved 15% reduction over their own baseline breathlessness intensity. Results: Eleven people had trial medication (eight males, median age 78 years (68 to 89), all had COPD, median Karnofsky 70 (50 to 80), six were on long-term home oxygen. Ten people completed day four. One person withdrew because of unsteadiness on day four. Five participants reached the 15% reduction, but only three went on to the extension study, all completing without toxicity. Conclusion: This study was safe, feasible and there appears to be a group who derive benefits comparable to titrated opioids. Given the widespread use of benzodiazepines for the symptomatic treatment of chronic refractory breathlessness and its poor evidence base, there is justification for a definitive phase III study. &&copy;Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.;Agar, M. 2013, 'EAPC early researcher award 2013 - Reflections on winning', European Journal of Palliative Care, vol. 20, no. 5, p. 248.;Agar, M. & Luckett, T. 2012, 'Outcome measures for palliative care research', Current Opinion in Supportive and Palliative Care, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 500-507.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Purpose of review The aim of this review is to summarize the current state of the science in physical symptoms and other endof-life care domains and/or illness-specific outcomes in palliative care. The review includes progress in outcome measure development and interpretation, with specific reference to the clinical trial context. Recent findings There are validated measures in a wide range of domains, which can measure outcomes specific to palliative care interventions, which are sufficiently validated to ensure the results of the trial are robust and measuring differences which are both clinically meaningful. In several areas, consensus is emerging which will allow consolidation of outcome measurement and the ability to extend measurement from the clinical trial setting into routine clinical practice. Potential exists for composite measures covering areas prioritized by patients to improve comparability and efficiency. Adverse events need to be measured with the same degree of rigor as efficacy outcomes. Summary Clinical trials of palliative care interventions need to consider a range of outcomes, however, the choice and timing of measurement of the primary outcome need to be guided by the domain most likely to be influenced by the intervention. &&copy;2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.;Agar, M., Draper, B., Phillips, P.A., Phillips, J., Collier, A., Harlum, J. & Currow, D. 2012, 'Making decisions about delirium: A qualitative comparison of decision making between nurses working in palliative care, aged care, aged care psychiatry, and oncology', Palliative Medicine, vol. 26, no. 7, pp. 887-896.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: Delirium has a significant impact on nursing practice from diagnosis and management, with under-detection and variable management of delirium being international problems.

Innovative approaches are needed to align health professional behaviours with best evidence delirium care.;Thongkhamcharoen, R., Agar, M., Breaden, K. & Hamzah, E. 2012, 'Dyspnea management in Palliative home care: A case series in Malaysia', Indian Journal of Palliative Care, vol. 18, no. 2, pp. 128-133.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Managing dyspnea at home is a challenging task. Although a competent palliative home care team can assist a patient to live at home with better pain control, dyspnea is usually not as well managed. In the Asian context, there are few research studies in dyspnea management in palliative home care. This paper aims to illustrate the cultural context that has an impact on dyspnea management at home and the assessment and management of dyspnea in a community palliative care setting in Malaysia. This paper reports on a study of 5 dyspneic patients suffering from both cancer-related and non-cancer-related dyspnea. Its focus is on a unique Asian cultural belief system that affects communication about prognosis and the role of family in palliative home care. In addition, this paper also describes dyspnea assessment, the barriers to morphine use, benzodiazepine prescription, oxygen therapy, and nonpharmacologic intervention in this center.;Hardy, J., Quinn, S., Fazekas, B., Plummer, J., Eckermann, S., Agar, M., Spruyt, O., Rowett, D. & Currow, D.C. 2012, 'Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of subcutaneous ketamine in the management of cancer pain', Journal of Clinical Oncology, vol. 30, no. 29, pp. 3611-3617.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Purpose: The anesthetic ketamine is widely used for pain related to cancer, but the evidence to support its use in this setting is weak. This study aimed to determine whether ketamine is more effective than placebo when used in conjunction with opioids and standard adjuvant therapy in the management of chronic uncontrolled cancer pain. Ketamine would be considered of net benefit if it provided clinically relevant improvement in pain with limited breakthrough analgesia and acceptable toxicity. Patients and Methods: In this multisite, dose-escalation, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial, ketamine or placebo was delivered subcutaneously over 3 to 5 days. Results: In all, 185 participants were included in the primary analysis. There was no significant difference between the proportion of positive outcomes (0.04, 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.18, P =.55) in the placebo and intervention arms (response rates, 27% [25 of 92] and 31% [29 of 93]). Pain type (nociceptive v neuropathic) was not a predictor of response. There was almost twice the incidence of adverse events worse than baseline in the ketamine group after day 1 (incidence rate ratio, 1.95, 95% CI, 1.46 to 2.61, P.001) and throughout the study. Those receiving ketamine were more likely to experience a more severe grade of adverse event per day (odds ratio, 1.09, 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.18, P =.039). The number of patients needed to treat for one additional patient to have a positive outcome from ketamine was 25 (95% CI, six to?). The number needed to harm, because of toxicity-related withdrawal, was six (95% CI, four to 13). Conclusion: Ketamine does not have net clinical benefit when used as an adjunct to opioids and standard coanalgesics in cancer pain. &&copy;2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.;Sheehan, C., Agar, M. & Currow, D.C. 2012, 'End-of-life research: Do we need to build proxy consent into all clinical trial protocols studying the terminal phase?', Journal of Palliative Medicine, vol. 15, no. 9, p. 962.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Shelby-James, T.M., Hardy, J., Agar, M., Yates, P., Mitchell, G., Sanderson, C., Luckett, T., Abernethy, A.P. & Currow, D.C. 2012, 'Designing and conducting randomized controlled trials in palliative care: A summary of discussions from the 2010 clinical research forum of the Australian Palliative Care Clinical Studies Collaborative', Palliative Medicine, vol. 26, no. 8, pp. 1042-1047.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Rigorous clinical research in palliative care is challenging but achievable.

Insights from the 2010 clinical research forum of the PaCCSC are reported. All active Australian researchers in palliative care were invited to present their current research and address three specific questions: (1) What has worked well? (2) What didn't work well? and (3) How should the research be done differently next time?Fourteen studies were presented, including six double-blind, randomized, controlled, multi-site trials run by the PaCCSC. Key recommendations are reported, including guidance on design, methodologies, and strategies for maximizing recruitment and retention. These recommendations will help to inform future trial design and conduct in palliative care. &&copy;2012 The Author(s).;Dimoska, A., Butow, P.N., Lynch, J., Hovey, E., Agar, M., Beale, P. & Tattersall, M.H.N. 2012, 'Implementing patient question-prompt lists into routine cancer care', Patient Education and Counseling, vol. 86, no. 2, pp. 252-258.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Objective: To examine the feasibility and acceptability of routine provision of patient question prompt lists (QPLs) to promote patient participation and patient-clinician communication in medical consultations. Methods: Four cancer centres across NSW, Australia (two rural, two urban) were invited to participate, involving distribution of QPLs to patients seeing a medical or radiation oncologist, or palliative care clinician. Patients rated their satisfaction after their next consultation. Cancer specialists provided their views at the end of the study. Results: Sixty-four percent (389/606) of patients attending consultations received a QPL. Of patients offered a QPL (426), 91% accepted. Of 139 patients surveyed post-consultation, 89% reported reading the QPL and, of these, 44% referred to the QPL during the consultation at least once. All of 10 cancer specialists providing their views post-implementation reported that QPL implementation in routine practice was feasible and did not strain resources. Conclusions: Cancer patients and cancer specialists showed support for routine dissemination of the QPL. Practice implications: For successful implementation of evidence-based tools we recommend promotion by local clinical champions, negotiation with clinic staff about dissemination methods, raised patient awareness through on-site project facilitators, media, consumer and support groups, and availability of resources in hard copy and via online sources. &&copy;2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;Clayton, J., Davidson, P.M., Phillips, J., Luckett, T., Green, A., Agar, M., Broadbent, A., Lovell, M. & ImPaCCT, S.T.O.P.P.P.T. 2012, 'STOP PAIN PROJECT: A COLLABORATIVE, INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT TO IMPROVE THE PERSON-CENTREDNESS OF ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF CANCER PAIN', ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY, vol. 8, pp. 267-267.;Clark, K., Currow, D., Talley, N., Dinning, P., Lam, L., Agar, M., Davidson, P., Shelby-James, T. & Phillips, J. 2012, 'Exploring the Underlying Physical Changes That Contribute to Bowel Problems in Palliative Care: Preliminary Result', JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE CARE, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 223-224.;Hardy, J., Quinn, S., Fazekas, B., Plummer, J., Eckermann, S., Agar, M., Spruyt, O., Rowett, D. & Currow, D. 2012, 'A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy and Toxicity of Subcutaneous Ketamine in the Management of Cancer Pain', JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE CARE, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 202-202.;To, T., Agar, M., Shelby-James, T., Abernethy, A., Doogue, M., Rowett, D. & Currow, D.C. 2012, 'Off-Label Prescribing in Palliative Care: A Cross-sectional National Survey of Australian Palliative Medicine Doctors', JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE CARE, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 189-190.;White, K., Agar, M. & Currow, D. 2012, 'FEASIBILITY OF MEASUREMENT OF FUNCTION IN ADVANCED CANCER: COMPARISON OF THE 6-MINUTE WALK TEST, 2-MINUTE WALK TEST, ISOMETRIC ARM EXERCISES AND READING NUMBERS ALOUD', JOURNAL OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY, vol. 7, no. 9, pp. S187-S188.;Currow, D.C. & Agar, M. 2012, 'Evidence-based practice - Where does the buck stop?', Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research, vol. 42, no. 2, pp. 91-93.;Agar, M. 2012, 'Pain and delirium', CME Journal Geriatric Medicine, vol. 14, no. 1, pp. 9-15.;Pain and delirium are significant clinical issues in the older person, which both impact on outcomes.

Methods: Literature was obtained via electronic database searches and hand searching of journals from 1990 to 2011. Results: Wide variability in perceptions of the value of chemotherapy in lung cancer is present among both physicians and patients. There is a mismatch in the degree patients and physicians weigh survival, such that patients value survival benefits highly whilst physicians strongly emphasize toxicity and associated symptoms. This lack of congruence between patients and clinicians is influenced by a range of factors and has implications for treatment decisions, long-term survival and quality of life in people affected by lung cancer. Conclusion: The divergence of treatment priorities indicates a need for improved communication strategies addressing the needs and concerns of both patients and clinicians. Patients should understand the benefits and risks of treatment options, while clinicians can gain a greater awareness of factors influencing patients' decisions on treatments. Reflecting these perspectives and patient preferences for lung cancer treatment in clinical guidelines may improve clinician awareness. &&copy;2011 Springer-Verlag.;Currow, D.C., Burns, C., Agar, M., Phillips, J., McCaffrey, N. & Abernethy, A.P. 2011, 'Palliative caregivers who would not take on the caring role again', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 41, no. 4, pp. 661-672.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Context: Health and social services rely heavily on family and friends for caregiving at the end of life. Objectives: This study sought to determine the prevalence and factors associated with an unwillingness to take on the caregiving role again by interviewing former caregivers of palliative care patients. Methods: The setting for this study was South Australia, with a population of 1.6 million people (7% of the Australian population) and used the South Australian Health Omnibus, an annual, face-to-face, cross-sectional, whole-of-population, multistage, systematic area sampling survey, which seeks a minimum of 3000 respondents each year statewide. One interview was conducted per household with the person over the age of 15 who most recently had a birthday. Using two years of data (n = 8377, 65.4% participation rate), comparisons between those who definitely would care again and those who would not was undertaken. Results: One in 10 people across the community provided hands-on care for someone close to them dying an expected death in the five years before being interviewed. One in 13 (7.4%) former caregivers indicated that they would not provide such care again irrespective of time since the person's death and despite no reported differences identified in unmet needs between those who would and would not care again. A further one in six (16.5%) would only \"probably care again.\" The regression model identified that increasing age lessens the willingness to care again (odds ratio [OR] 3.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56, 9.95) and so does lower levels of education (OR 0.413, 95% CI 0.18, 0.96) controlling for spousal relationship. Conclusion: These data suggest that assessment of willingness to care needs to be considered by clinical teams, especially in the elderly. Despite most active caregivers being willing to provide care again, a proportion would not. &&copy;2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.;Lobb, E.A., Swetenham, K., Agar, M. & Currow, D.C. 2011, 'A collateral benefit of research in palliative care', Journal of Palliative Medicine, vol. 14, no. 9, pp. 986-987.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Connell, T., Griffiths, R., Fernandez, R.S., Tran, D., Agar, M. & Harlum, J. 2011, 'Quality-of-life trajectory of clients and carers referred to a community palliative care service', International Journal of Palliative Nursing, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 80-85.;Palliative care clients often have a reduced quality of life (QOL).

A total of 49 clients and 43 carers respectively completed the McGill QOL scale (MQOL) and the caregiver QOL cancer scale (CQOLC) questionnaires. Baseline data relating to demographics, health status, and QOL are presented for the 49 participants and their 43 carers, and these are compared with follow-up data from 22 clients and 13 carers (matched pairs). On average, there were no significant differences between baseline and follow-up QOL scores in any respects for either clients or carers, including measures of burden, disruptiveness, positive adaptation, and financial concerns. Whether this indicates that the care administered succeeded in cancelling out the worsening of the clients' conditions or whether it indicates a shortcoming of the care was not assessed.;To, T.H.M., Greene, A.G., Agar, M.R. & Currow, D.C. 2011, 'A point prevalence survey of hospital inpatients to define the proportion with palliation as the primary goal of care and the need for specialist palliative care', Internal Medicine Journal, vol. 41, no. 5, pp. 430-433.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;The direct burden of people whose goal of care is a palliative approach has not been estimated in the acute care setting. Using a single time point, cross-sectional survey of all inpatient beds, an estimate was generated across a network of three South Australian public hospitals. One in three inpatients had a palliative approach as the goal of care and of these, only one in five had been referred to specialist palliative care services. Those referred were significantly more likely to have cancer and be younger men. Active recognition and documentation that a palliative approach frames the goals of care for this person needs to be incorporated more systematically into clinical practice in the acute care setting. At the same time, triggers for needs-based referral for specialist assessment should be implemented. Specialist palliative care services must also provide direct care for a wider range of patients than just those with cancer. &&copy;2011 The Authors.

[1] The goals in cancer pain treatment includes maintaining function in patients with cancer pain (especially in earlier stage disease), and palliation in advanced disease. [1] The perception of the lay public and inexperienced clinicians that addiction is inevitable, often leads to an inappropriate fear to utilize opioids to appropriately manage pain, resulting in persistent under-treatment of cancer pain internationally. [2,3] There is much confusion about the phenomenon of physical dependence and how this can be differentiated from the maladaptive behaviors that constitute a diagnosis of substance abuse. The burden of cancer and associated cancer pain is projected to continue to rise, and is often at an advanced stage at diagnosis in less developed countries. [4] To be able to provide quality care for this patient population availability of opioids and skilled clinicians in pain management is paramount. In the majority of cases, the main concern is to abate concerns about risks of opioid addiction, to allow adequate pain relief. To understand the infrequent phenomenon of substance abuse in the setting of cancer pain management clear definitions are needed, and review of the epidemiology of occurrence in cancer populations is needed. It is also important to clearly separate the issues of substance abuse at the patient level and diversion of prescribed opioids. There are principles of managing cancer pain in the rare clinical scenario when the risk of substance abuse is high, which can still allow safe management of cancer pain with opioids.;Currow, D.C., Agar, M.R., To, T.H.M., Rowett, D., Greene, A. & Abernethy, A.P. 2011, 'Adverse events in hospice and palliative care: A pilot study to determine feasibility of collection and baseline rates', Journal of Palliative Medicine, vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 309-314.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Background: Continuous quality improvement is fundamental in all health care, including hospice and palliative care. Identifying and systematically reducing symptomatic adverse events is limited in hospice and palliative care because these events are mostly attributed to disease progression. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of symptomatic adverse events in hospice and palliative care and assessing their incidence. Methods: A retrospective, consecutive cohort of notes from a specialist palliative care inpatient service was surveyed by a clinical nurse consultant for symptomatic adverse events: falls, confusion, decreased consciousness, hypo- and hyperglycaemia, urinary retention, and hypotension. Demographic and clinical factors were explored for people at higher risk. Results: Data were available on the most recent admissions of 65 people, generating 900 inpatient days. Fifty people (78%) had events precipitating admission, of whom 31 (62%) had at least one further event during admission. Eleven of 15 people who were admitted without an event experienced at least one during their admissions. Only 4 did not have an adverse event. During their stay, there were 0.13 (standard deviation [SD]=0.19) events per patient per day. No drug-drug or drug-host events were noted. No clinical or demographic factors predicted groups at higher risk. Conclusions: This pilot highlights the feasibility of collecting, and ubiquity of, symptomatic adverse events, and forms a baseline against which future interventions to decrease the frequency or intensity can be measured. Given the frailty of hospice and palliative patients, any adverse event is likely to accelerate irreversibly their systemic decline. &&copy;Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011.;Currow, D.C., Agar, M.R. & Abernethy, A.P. 2011, 'Tackling the Challenges of Clinical Trials in Palliative Care', Pharmaceutical Medicine, vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 7-15.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Currow, D.C., Agar, M.R. & Abernethy, A.P. 2011, 'Tackling the challenges of clinical trials in palliative care', Pharmaceutical Medicine, vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 7-15.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;There is an ethical imperative to provide the best quality of care for all people, including people at the end of life. In order to provide such care, each intervention used in clinical practice must be tested objectively for net clinical benefit (response and toxicity). For pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, the gold standard of evidence remains a phase III randomized, controlled study. In palliative care, there is a gradually emerging evidence base for clinical practice derived from rigorously designed and conducted interventional studies. Such studies can effectively recruit, even in this clinical setting, to completion.There are design and implantation challenges in all controlled clinical trials. Some issues are highly likely in palliative care and will influence trial design and analysis including expected attrition unrelated to the intervention, wide variation in the diagnosis and timing of referral to individual palliative care services and responsible reporting of serious adverse events. Factors that are not unique to palliative care but are often magnified in such studies include concerns by referrers and participants about randomization and blinding, how and when to measure endpoints that are clinically relevant, how to minimize the burden of data collection, ensuring studies are adequately powered and how best to deal with primary outcomes that are subjective. Many studies in the palliative care population have successfully overcome these challenges by thoughtful study design. Factors associated with successful (palliative care) study completion include (i) a shared vision about what the research is designed to achieve, (ii) governance structures independent of the researchers, (iii) ways of defining standard practice for the control arm using best available evidence and consensus, (iv) face-to-face meetings especially for protocol development, (v) adequate funding given estimates that four to six palliative care patients will be s...;Currow, D.C., Smith, J., Davidson, P.M., Newton, P.J., Agar, M.R. & Abernethy, A.P. 2010, 'Do the Trajectories of Dyspnea Differ in Prevalence and Intensity By Diagnosis at the End of Life?

Objectives: To determine differences in the intensity of breathlessness by diagnosis over time as death approaches in a consecutive cohort seen by a specialist palliative care service. Methods: Patients referred to Silver Chain Hospice Care Service over a period of four years (January 2004 to December 2007) had dyspnea evaluated at every clinical encounter until death. A numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to measure the intensity. Patients were categorized into five clusters (lung cancer, secondary cancer to lung, heart failure, end-stage pulmonary disease, and no identifiable cardiorespiratory cause) at three time points (60-53 [T3], 30-23 [T2], and 7-0 [T1] days before death [T0]). Group differences were assessed using analysis of variance. Joinpoint regression models defined significant changes in mean breathlessness intensity. Results: For 5,862 patients, data were collected an average of 20 times (median: 13, 116,982 data points) for an average of 86 days (median: 48). Breathlessness was significantly higher at all three time points in people with noncancer diagnoses. Breathlessness increased significantly at days 10 and 3 before death for people with cancer (P 0.001 for both), but remained unchanged, albeit significantly higher for patients with noncancer diagnoses. In the three months leading to death, the prevalence of \"no breathlessness\" decreased from 50% to 35%, and the proportion of patients with severe breathlessness (7 out of 10) increased from 10% to 26%.

The aim of this study was to focus estimates on pain severe enough to interfere markedly with daily function irrespective of contact with health services in another region, South Australia. Methods: A whole of population random face-to-face survey method (n=2,973) was used, directly standardised against the whole population for age, gender, country of birth and rurality. Respondents were asked about chronic pain and the degree to which it interfered with daily activities. Results:Tbe prevalence of chronic pain was 17.9%, and pain that interfered extremely with activity 5.0%. Chronic pain was associated with older age, living alone, lower income, not being in full-time work and lower educational levels in bivariate analyses, however in multifactor analyses the only significant associations were not currently working (p0.001) and lower levels of educational achievement (p=0.042). Pain that interfered extremely with activity in multifactor analysis was associated with work status where the odds ratio for work-related injury compared to those in full time work was 19.3 (95% Cl 7.30-51.3, p0.001). Conclusions: This study highlights the high levels of pain with extreme effects on day-to-day life (one in 20 people), the complex inter-relationships of the factors (educational achievement, work status) associated with chronic pain and the impacts that these factors have on the people experiencing such disabling pain in the long-term. &&copy;Public Health Association of Australia.;Agar, M., To, T., Plummer, J., Abernethy, A. & Currow, D. 2010, 'Anti-cholinergic load, health care utilization, and survival in people with advanced cancer: A pilot study', Journal of Palliative Medicine, vol. 13, no. 6, pp. 745-752.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Introduction: Anti-cholinergic medications have been associated with increased risks of cognitive impairment, premature mortality and increased risk of hospitalisation.

A retrospective analysis of 211 admissions to a palliative care unit was undertaken, with the main aim being to identify some factors, which influence laxative prescription. On univariate analysis, significant unadjusted associations were found between two or more prescribed laxatives and a diagnosis of malignancy, morphine equivalent dose, type of illness phase and the subsequent phase type, length of phase, anticholinergic load imposed by medications, symptom severity and functional status. Multiple ordinal logistic regressions revealed the prescription of one laxative to be significantly associated with oral morphine-equivalent dose, total anticholinergic load (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0 - 2.0), disease progression to terminal phase and death (OR 0.1, 95% CI = 0.0 - 0.3), and length of phase (OR 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0 - 1.2). Similar results were obtained for the prescription of two or more laxatives. Two additional measures of function, toileting (OR 3.6, 95% CI = 1.6 - 8.2) and transfer (OR 0.4 95% CI = 0.2 - 0.9), also became significant. Total anticholinergic load was significantly associated with the prescription of a single laxative (OR 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0 - 2.0) and two or more laxatives (OR 1.8, 95% CI = 1.3 - 2.5) for each unit increase in anticholinergic load. Opioids and in particular opioids prescribed at higher doses, the total anticholinergic load associated with prescribed medications, the degree of impaired physical function of a person, their length of stay in a palliative care unit and their proximity to death were all strongly related to the prescription of laxatives. &&copy;The Author(s) 2010.;Currow, D.C., Shelby-James, T.M., Agar, M., Plummer, J., Rowett, D., Glare, P., Spruyt, O. & Hardy, J. 2010, 'Planning phase III multi-site clinical trials in palliative care: The role of consecutive cohort audits to identify potential participant populations', Supportive Care in Cancer, vol. 18, no. 12, pp. 1571-1579.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Goals of work: Multiple sites enable more successful completion of adequately powered phase III studies in palliative care.

The audit covered all deaths in a 3-month period for people who were referred to a specialist palliative care service who had at least one inpatient admission between referral and death, regardless of when the person was referred to the service. The audits were based around inclusion and exclusion criteria for the proposed studies. Main results: Of the 468 people whose medical records were reviewed, potential study participant rates varied by symptom having accounted for general and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria: pain 17.7%, delirium 5.8%, anorexia 5.1%, bowel obstruction 2.8% and cholestatic itch 0%. For those people with a symptom of interest, it was noted at the beginning of the inpatient admission more than half the time. Of all inpatients, fewer than one third would be eligible to participate in at least one study. Conclusions: These data provide a baseline estimate of potential people to approach about clinical trials in supportive care but do not account for clinician 'gate-keeping', lack of interest in participating nor withdrawal from the study once initiated. The data are retrospective and therefore, limited by clinical documentation. The audit directly informed an increase in the number of part...;Agar, M. 2010, 'Palliative care: Compassion, care and complexity', Cancer Forum, vol. 34, no. 2, pp. 73-74.;Sanderson, C. & Agar, M. 2010, 'Delirium in advanced cancer', Cancer Forum, vol. 34, no. 2, pp. 77-82.;Delirium is a distressing and under-diagnosed syndrome of acute alteration in mental state. It occurs frequently in patients with advanced cancer and is often associated with a worsening of prognosis and difficult challenges in symptom management. Given its associations with older age, recognition and management of delirious patients are likely to become an even more important aspect of oncological practice in the future. The potential for prevention of delirium is being studied, and protocols which involve modifications in hospital care, in addition to screening and rapid identification and treatment of precipitants, may reduce the burden of the condition. However, such approaches require further study and validation in an advanced cancer population. Routine use of appropriate and validated screening tools is a low burden strategy which is likely to improve diagnosis, care and understanding of delirium. The evidence to guide pharmacological management is not strong. Well designed clinical trials are urgently needed in order to improve supportive care outcomes for delirious patients and to clarify the role of antipsychotic and other medications in symptomatic management.;Shelby-James, T., Agar, M.R. & Currow, D.C. 2010, 'A case study evaluation of ethics review systems for multicentre clinical trials', Medical Journal of Australia, vol. 192, no. 5, p. 292.;Ward, A.M., Agar, M. & Koczwara, B. 2009, 'Collaborating or co-existing: A survey of attitudes of medical oncologists toward specialist palliative care', Palliative Medicine, vol. 23, no. 8, pp. 698-707.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Patients with advanced cancer often have complex care needs requiring collaboration between medical oncology and palliative care providers. Little is known about how effective and acceptable such collaboration is to medical oncologists. Attitudes of Australian medical oncologists toward collaboration with specialist palliative care services were investigated using a Web-based survey. Descriptive statistics and attitude indices were calculated and a thematic content analysis performed. One hundred and fifteen respondents (78 medical oncologists, 37 trainees) completed the survey (response rate 30.3%). Positive attitudes toward specialist palliative care involvement were expressed with most respondents preferring concurrent rather than sequential models of care (94.8%, n = 109). Reported barriers to collaboration included reluctance for referral by patients (minor 60.9%, n = 70, major 8.7%, n = 10) or families (minor 67%, n = 77, major 7%, n = 8), a lack of inpatient beds (minor 27%, n = 31, major 34.8%, n = 40) and inadequate resources for specialist palliative care to take some referrals (minor 30.4%, n = 35, major 30.4%, n = 35). There was no difference in attitude indices for those who had completed a palliative care rotation during their training (33%, n = 38) and those who had not. Suggestions for improvement in collaboration focused around four areas - improved resources, improved multidisciplinary links, mutual respect and understanding, and consistency in service provision. This study is the first to specifically investigate the views of Australian medical oncologists toward collaboration with specialist palliative care. While positive attitudes have been expressed, identified barriers to collaboration need attention.;Agar, M., Currow, D., Plummer, J., Seidel, R., Carnahan, R. & Abernethy, A.P. 2009, 'Changes in anticholinergic load from regular prescribed medications in palliative care as death approaches', Palliative Medicine, vol. 23, no. 3, pp. 257-265.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Although there is an understandable emphasis on the side effects of individual medications, the cumulative effects of medications have received little attention in palliative care prescribing. Anticholinergic load reflects a cumulative effect of medications that may account for several symptoms and adverse health outcomes frequently encountered in palliative care. A secondary analysis of 304 participants in a randomised controlled trial had their cholinergic load calculated using the Clinician-Rated Anticholinergic Scale (modified version) longitudinally as death approached from medication data collected prospectively by study nurses on each visit. Mean time from referral to death was 107 days, and mean 4.8 visits were conducted in which data were collected. Relationships to key factors were explored. Data showed that anticholinergic load rose as death approached because of increasing use of medications for symptom control. Symptoms significantly associated with increasing anticholinergic load included dry mouth and difficulty concentrating (P 0.05). There were also significant associations with increasing anticholinergic load and decreasing functional status (Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Scale, and quality of life (P 0.05). This study has documented in detail the longitudinal anticholinergic load associated with medications used in a palliative care population between referral and death, demonstrating the biggest contributor to anticholinergic load in a palliative care population is from symptom-specific medications, which increased as death approached.;Currow, D.C., Agar, M., Smith, J. & Abernethy, A.P. 2009, 'Does palliative home oxygen improve dyspnoea? A consecutive cohort study', Palliative Medicine, vol. 23, no. 4, pp. 309-316.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Palliative oxygen for refractory dyspnoea is frequently prescribed, even when the criteria for long-term home oxygen (based on survival, rather than the symptomatic relief of breathlessness) are not met. Little is known about how palliative home oxygen affects symptomatic breathlessness. A 4 -year consecutive cohort from a regional community palliative care service in Western Australia was used to compare baseline breathlessness before oxygen therapy with dyspnoea sub-scales on the symptom assessment scores (SAS, 0-10) 1 and 2 weeks after the introduction of oxygen. Demographic and clinical characteristics of people who responded were included in a multi-variable logistic regression model. Of the study population (n = 5862), 21.1% (n = 1239) were prescribed oxygen of whom 413 had before and after data that could be included in this analysis. The mean breathlessness before home oxygen was 5.3 (SD 2.5, median 5, range 0-10). There were no significant differences overall at 1 or 2 weeks (P = 0.28) nor for any diagnostic sub-groups. One hundred and fifty people (of 413) had more than a 20% improvement in mean dyspnoea scores. In multi-factor analysis, neither the underlying diagnosis causing breathlessness nor the demographic factors predicted responders at 1 week. Oxygen prescribed on the basis of breathlessness alone across a large population predominantly with cancer does not improve breathlessness for the majority of people. Prospective randomised trials in people with cancer and non-cancer are needed to determine whether oxygen can reduce the progression of breathlessness compared to a control arm. &&copy;2009 SAGE Publications.;Agar, M., Currow, D., Plummer, J., Seidel, R., Carnahan, R. & Abernethy, A.P. 2009, 'Changes in Anticholinergic Load From Regular Prescribed Medications in Palliative Care as Death Approaches Editorial Comment', JOURNAL OF UROLOGY, vol. 182, no. 6, pp. 2840-2840.;Clark, K., Currow, D.C., Agar, M., Fazekas, B.S. & Abernethy, A.P. 2008, 'A pilot phase II randomized, cross-over, double-blinded, controlled efficacy study of octreotide versus hyoscine hydrobromide for control of noisy breathing at the end-of-life', Journal of Pain and Palliative Care Pharmacotherapy, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 131-138.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Noisy breathing at the end of life (noisy breathing (NB) occurs in up to 90% of people. Interventions have not been systematically evaluated. There has been clinical observation coupled with a proposed mechanism of effect that supports a role for octreotide in management of NB. The aim of this phase II study was to assess ten completed participants for the feasibility of an adequately powered phase III study. This randomized, double-blind, crossover pilot trial recruited participants from an inpatient palliative unit. Participants while well and their proxies simultaneously provided written informed consent. If NB were encountered, people were randomized to 200 mcg octreotide or 400 mcg hyoscine hydrobromide subcutaneously. If subsequent treatment was needed, the other medication was administered. A five point categorical scale documented the nurses' assessment of secretions over six hours. Eighty participants were consented of whom 10 (3 females, 7 males, median age 79, all with advanced cancer) received medication, five in each arm. There was no difference in the median time to administration of the second medication (3 hours). Two participants in each arm had a 2 category reduction of intensity after the second medication. Although feasible to consent and study this population in a way that respects autonomy and dignity even in the terminal hours of life, this pilot study suggests reconsideration of the pharmacological interventions (choice of agents, dosing, timing of dosing and pharmacokinetic profiles), standardizing of non-pharmacological care, and ways to measure directly family distress before further randomized studies for this symptom. &&copy;2008 by Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

This study aimed to describe longitudinal preferences for place of care and place of death over time for patients and their caregivers. Longitudinal paired data of patient/caregiver dyads from a prospective unblinded cluster randomised control trial were used. Patients and caregivers were separately asked by the palliative care nurse their preference at that time for place of care and place of death. Longitudinal changes over time for both questions were mapped, patterns of agreement (patient and caregiver, and preference for place of death when last asked and actual placed of death) were analysed with kappa statistics. Seventy-one patient/caregiver dyads were analysed. In longitudinal preferences, preferences for both the place of care (asked a mean of 6 times) and place of death (asked a mean of 4 times) changed for patients (28% and 30% respectively) and caregivers (31% and 30%, respectively). In agreement between patients and caregivers, agreement between preference of place of care and preferred place of death when asked contemporaneously for patients and caregivers was low [56% (? 0.33) and 36% (? 0.35) respectively]. In preference versus actual place of death, preferences were met for 37.5% of participants for home death, 62.5% for hospital, 76.9% for hospice and 63.6% for aged care facility. This study suggests that there are two conversations: preference for current place of care and preference for care at the time of death. Place of care is not a euphemism for place of death, and further research is needed to delineate these. Patient and caregiver preferences may not change simultaneously. Implications of any mismatch between actual events and preferences need to be explored.;Leonard, M., Agar, M., Mason, C. & Lawlor, P. 2008, 'Delirium issues in palliative care settings', Journal of Psychosomatic Research, vol. 65, no. 3, pp. 289-298.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Objective: The objective of this study is to provide an expert review of delirium in the context of palliative care. Methods: Based on a primary selection criterion, firstly, studies were included for review if the population studied either had a diagnosis of advanced cancer or was receiving palliative care, alternatively, in the absence of data derived from these populations, studies conducted in other populations were included. Secondly, from the studies meeting the primary selection criterion, we selected those that examined specific standard outcome measures. Thirdly, we selected studies and literature reviews that identified delirium research issues. Results: Delirium occurs commonly in the context of palliative care where it is likely to cause heightened distress for patients, carers, and families alike, and make interpretation of pain and other symptoms extremely difficult. There is a profound dearth of rigorous studies on delirium in this setting. Ambiguous terminology, varying definitions in internationally recognized classification systems, and failure to use validated assessment tools lead to wide-ranging incidence and prevalence of delirium episodes in such populations. Episodes are usually multifactorial in origin and may portend poor prognosis by preceding death in many cases. Despite this, many are often at least partially reversible with relatively low-burden interventions. The patient's disease status, previous quality of life, and prior expressed wishes regarding goals of care should all be taken into account. Antipsychotics are the pharmacotherapeutic agents most commonly used to control symptoms despite limited evidence either supporting their efficacy or examining their adverse event profile. Often, symptomatic control alone is indicated. In cases with refractory symptoms, deeper or \"palliative\" sedation may be required.

The aim was to survey current practice of specialists using two contrasting cases of delirium in cancer. Methods: A questionnaire was designed to identify investigations and treatment used, in relation to two cases. Results: Overall response rate (n = 270) was 30%. Place of care: Only 35% of medical oncologists would consider care at home for a patient with reversible delirium compared with 66% of other specialists. Investigations: 85% specialists would order basic bloods, however, medical oncologists were more likely to use oxygen saturation and head computed tomography, psychogeriatricians more likely to order thyroid function and palliative medicine specialists less likely to order chest X-ray and urine culture. Greater than 40% of specialists would do no investigations for terminal delirium. Treatment: Medical oncologists use more pre-emptive therapies and more likely to use a benzodiazepine as agent of choice, and Palliative medicine specialists used significantly more neuroleptics to treat hypoactive symptoms of delirium. Discussion: The survey emphasise significant areas of variability in the management of delirium in advanced cancer. Furthermore, evidence to guide management in ways that draw on the strengths and knowledge of each specialty is urgently needed. &&copy;2008 SAGE Publications.;Agar, M. & Lawlor, P. 2008, 'Delirium in cancer patients: A focus on treatment-induced psychopathology', Current Opinion in Oncology, vol. 20, no. 4, pp. 360-366.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Validated tools exist to assist in the assessment of delirium. Although our understanding of the pathogenesis of delirium has improved somewhat, there remains a compelling need to further elucidate the underlying pathophysiology, especially in relation to opioids and the other psychoactive medications that are used in supportive care.

Have caregivers of patients who have not accessed SPCS had their needs met? Methods: As part of a broader state-wide randomized face-to-face population health survey over six years (18 224 interviews, 71% response), questions were asked of people bereaved in the previous five years when someone close to them died an 'expected' death (39% of respondents). Questions included respondent demographics, the diagnosis of the deceased and, for one year, whether SPCS was of benefit (if used) or needed (if not used). Differential uptake rates were calculated for diagnosis, income, country of birth and age and 2 2 tables reflecting the accuracy of match of service with caregiver needs were generated for each group (accuracy = true positives + true negatives/ total) *100. Results: Uptake of SPCS was significantly lower in people with a non-cancer diagnosis (40% versus 62%, P = 0.0001), lower income (56% versus 61%, P = 0.0006) and people born where English was not the first language (52% versus 58%, P = 0.0096). The only subgroup where the accuracy of matching between palliative care service uptake and identified needs was lower than the overall average (83%) was where cancer was not the life-limiting illness (69%, cancer 86%). Discussion: SPCS under utilization has previously been described in the population subgroups explored in this study and assumed to equal unmet needs and poorer outcomes. Caregiver responses suggest that, except for people with a non-cancer diagnosis, lack of service uptake may not represent unmet needs. These results are limited to people with caregivers. &&copy;2008 SAGE Publications, Los Angeles, London, New Delhi and Singapore.;Leonard, M., Agar, M., Mason, C. & Lawlor, P. 2008, 'Delirium issues in palliative care settings', JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH, vol. 65, no. 3, pp. 289-298.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Agar, M., Chye, R., Currow, D. & Draper, B. 2006, 'Survey of current practice: Management of delirium by palliative care, psychogeriatric, geriatric, and oncology specialists in Australia and New Zealand', JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE CARE, vol. 22, no. 3, pp. 209-210.;Agar, M., Webster, R., Lacey, J., Donovan, B. & Walker, A. 2004, 'The use of subcutaneous omeprazole in the treatment of dyspepsia in palliative care patients [1]', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 28, no. 6, pp. 529-531.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Agar, M., Broadbent, A. & Chye, R. 2004, 'The management of malignant psoas syndrome: Case reports and literature review', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 282-293.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Malignant psoas syndrome (MPS) was first described in 1990, and is characterized by proximal lumbosacral plexopathy, painful fixed flexion of the ipsilateral hip, and radiological or pathological evidence of ipsilateral psoas major muscle malignant involvement. There have been 23 case reports of MPS in medical journals. Despite being associated with a severe and difficult pain, there is no definitive approach to management presented in the palliative care literature. We review the relevant clinical features and the subsequent multidisciplinary pain management in relation to four new cases of malignant involvement of the psoas muscle, and the 23 case reports in the literature. We propose that MPS comprises a continuum of symptoms and signs related to the degree of anatomical destruction with associated inflammatory reaction and muscle spasm, and also the degree of lumbosacral plexopathy causing neuropathic pain. A protocol is presented for the management of the complex pain issues of MPS directed at likely mechanisms. The treatment options include opioids, agents for neuropathic pain, muscle relaxants to manage psoas muscle spasm, and anti-inflammatory agents to reduce peritumoral edema. Direct anti-tumor measures also need to be considered. Further prospective study is needed to validate the proposed methods of assessment and treatment. &&copy;2004 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

Background: Simulation allows students to practice key psychomotor skills and gain technical proficiency, fostering the development of clinical reasoning and student confidence in a low risk environment. Manikins are a valuable learning tool, yet there is a distinct lack of empirical research investigating how to enhance engagement between nursing students and manikins. Objective: To describe student perspectives of a layered, technology enhanced approach to improve the simulation learning experience. Educational Framework: Tanner's Model of Clinical Judgment underpins the entire curriculum. This study additionally drew on the principles of narrative pedagogy. Intervention: Across ten teaching weeks, five separate case studies were introduced to students through short vignettes. Students viewed the vignettes prior to their laboratory class. In the labs, manikins were dressed in the props used in the vignettes. Setting: The innovation was trialed in a second year core subject of a Bachelor of Nursing program in a large urban university in the autumn semester of 2014. Data Collection and Analysis: Following ethics approval, students were emailed a participant information sheet. A focus group of nine students was held. The discussion was digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim prior to being subject to thematic analysis. Students' comments (143) about the vignettes in their standard subject specific student feedback surveys were also considered as data. Results: Four themes were identified: Getting past the plastic, knowing what to say, connecting and caring, and, embracing diversity. The feedback indicated that these measures increased students ability to suspend disbelief, feel connected to, and approach the manikins in a more understanding and empathetic fashion. Conclusions: In addition to achieving increased engagement with manikins, other advantages such as students reflecting on their own values and pre-conceived notions of people fro...;Disler, R.T., Green, A., Luckett, T., Newton, P.J., Inglis, S., Currow, D.C. & Davidson, P.M. 2014, 'Experience of advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Metasynthesis of qualitative research', Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 48, no. 6, pp. 1182-1199.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Context Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a life-limiting illness. Despite best available treatments, individuals continue to experience symptom burden and have high health care utilization. Objectives To increase understanding of the experience and ongoing needs of individuals living with COPD. Methods Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Sociological s were searched for articles published between January 1990 and June 2013. Metasynthesis of qualitative data followed the principles of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Metasyntheses are increasingly used to gain understandings of complex research questions through synthesizing data from individual qualitative studies. Descriptive and analytical themes were developed through thematic synthesis and expert panel discussion of extracted primary quotes, not the primary data themselves. Results Twenty-two studies were included. Four hundred twenty-two free codes were condensed into seven descriptive themes: better understanding of condition, breathlessness, fatigue, frailty, anxiety, social isolation, and loss of hope and maintaining meaning. These seven themes were condensed further into three analytical themes that described the experience and ongoing needs of individuals with COPD: the need for better understanding of condition, sustained symptom burden, and the unrelenting psychological impact of living with COPD. Conclusion Combining discrete qualitative studies provided a useful perspective of the experience of living with COPD over the past two decades. Further studies into the ongoing needs of individuals with COPD are unlikely to add to this well-established picture. Future research should focus on solutions through the development of interventions that address patients' ongoing needs.;Jackson, D., Hickman, L.D., Power, T., Disler, R., Potgieter, I., Deek, H. & Davidson, P.M. 2014, 'Small group learning: Graduate health students' views of challenges and benefits', Contemporary Nurse, vol. 48, no. 1, pp. 117-128.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;copy;eContent Management Pty Ltd. Background: For health-care professionals, particularly nurses, the need to work productively and efficiently in small groups is a crucial skill required to meet the challenges of the contemporary health-care environment. Small group work is an educational technique that is used extensively in nurse education. The advantage of group work includes facilitation of deep, active and collaborative learning. However, small group work can be problematic and present challenges for students. Many of the challenges occur because group work necessitates the coming together of collections of individuals, each with their own personalities and sets of experiences. Aim: This study aimed to identify challenges and benefits associated with small group work and to explore options for retaining the positive aspects of group work while reducing or eliminating the aspects the students experienced as negative. Method: Online survey, thematic analysis. Results: Over all, students experienced a range of challenges that necessitated the development of problem-solving strategies. However, they were able to elucidate some enjoyable and positive aspects of group work. Implications for teaching and learning are drawn from this study. Conclusion: The ability to work effectively in small groups and teams is essential for all health-care workers in the contemporary health environment. Findings of this study highlight the need for educators to explore novel and effective ways in which to engage nurses in group work.;Donesky, D.M., Nguyen, H.Q., Carrieri-Kohlman, V. & Disler, R. 2014, 'Dyspnea Self-Management Programs: Who Benefits?', Am J Respir Crit Care Med, vol. 189, pp. A2654-A2654.;Disler, R.T., Rochester, S.F., Kelly, M.A., White, H.L. & Forber, J. 2013, 'Delivering a large cohort simulation - Beginning nursing students' experience: A pre-post survey', Journal of Nursing Education and Practice, vol. 3, no. 12, pp. 133-142.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: The use of simulation has been growing rapidly within nursing programs, internationally.

A palliative approach is appropriate for individuals with end-stage COPD, yet currently few interventions embrace this holistic, multidisciplinary and inclusive perspective. Objective: To describe interventions to support a palliative care approach in patients with end-stage COPD. Design: Integrative review. Data sources and review method: Peer reviewed articles meeting the search criteria were accessed from Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases as well as Caresearch online resource. The domains of quality palliative care developed by Steinhauser were used as the conceptual framework to synthesise information. Results: This review has shown that a range of palliative interventions are used to address the needs of individuals with end-stage COPD. Although evidence exists for discrete elements of palliative management in this patient group, there is limited evidence for health service coordination and models that integrate the multiple domains of palliative care with active management. Conclusion: Further investigation is required to address the complex personal, provider and system elements associated with managing end-stage COPD. A comprehensive and collaborative approach is required to address the complex and varied needs of individuals with end-stage COPD and their families. &&copy;2012 Elsevier Ltd.;Disler, R.T., Gallagher, R.D. & Davidson, P.M. 2012, 'Factors influencing self-management in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: An integrative review', International Journal of Nursing Studies, vol. 49, no. 2, pp. 230-242.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common, chronic and burdensome condition requiring the individual to engage in a range of self-management strategies. The capacity to engage in self-management is dependent on a range of internal (e.g. personal) and external (e.g. health service) factors. Objectives: This paper seeks to define self-management, identify the determinants which influence the individual's ability to cope and adjust to living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the community, and identify implications for clinical practice and research. Design: Integrative review. Data sources: Medline, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Google Scholar. Review methods: Integrative review using prospective research questions. Papers were included in the review if they were published in peer reviewed journals and written in English between 2000 and 2010. Articles were accepted for inclusion if they discussed the determinants that influenced self-management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the community. Confirmation of results and discussion themes was validated by specialists in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and complex care. Findings: Self-management is less well characterised in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared with other chronic conditions. Functional limitation and the need to balance disease management with everyday life are the two key elements that patients face in managing their condition. Provider characteristics, socioeconomic status and health literacy are sparsely discussed yet are known to influence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease self-management. Conclusions: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease self-management must be a key focus internationally as the disease incidence increases. Collaborative care is required between patients and health providers in order facilitate patients in confident management of their condition. &&copy;2011 Elsevier Ltd.;Hayder 2012, 'Unmet Needs in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Metasynthesis Protocol', International Journal of Research in Nursing, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 15-20.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Rochester, S., Kelly, M., Disler, R., White, H., Forber, J. & Matiuk, S. 2012, 'Providing simulation experiences for large cohorts of 1st year nursing students: Evaluating quality and impact', Collegian, vol. 19, no. 3, pp. 117-124.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;To provide each student within a large cohort the opportunity to participate in a small group simulation that meets recognised quality indicators is a challenge for Bachelor of Nursing programmes in Australia. This paper, as part of a larger longitudinal study, describes one approach used to manage a simulation for 375 1st year nursing students and to report on the quality of the experience from the student's perspective. To ensure quality was maintained within the large cohort, aspects of the simulation were assessed against the following indicators: alignment with curriculum pedagogy and goals, preparation of students and staff, fidelity, and debriefing. Data obtained from a student focus group were analysed in the context of the quality indicators. The following themes emerged from the data: knowing what to expect, assuming roles for the simulation, authenticity and thinking on your feet, feeling the RN role, and, preparation for clinical practice. This paper demonstrates it is possible to provide students in large cohorts with active participatory roles in simulations whilst maintaining quality indicators. &&copy;2012 Royal College of Nursing, Australia.;Disler, R., Inglis, S.C., Currow, D.C. & Davidson, P.M. 2012, 'Palliative and Supportive Care in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Research Priorities to Decrease Suffering. 1: 301. doi: 10.4172/scientificreports. 301 Page 2 of 3 Volume 1* Issue 6* 2012 Providers' confidence in undertaking end-of-life discussions would improve through training in: techniques for initiating discussion, the content which patients' value, and what services are available to end-stage COPD patients [10, 22]', Better understanding for patients and providers, and the use of a unifying framework such as the Chronic Care Model, would assist in the early implementation of system interventions and advance care planning that support patients through the palliative phase of their disease [10, 22, 23].;Disler, R. & Jones, A. 2010, 'District nurse role in end-stage COPD: a review', British Journal of Community Nursing, vol. 15, no. 9, pp. 428-433.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Lawrence, J., Fisher, I., Chan, A. & Disler, R.T. 2010, 'In-situ fluid loss from the anchoring balloon in silicon catheters: does it compromise clinical efficacy and safety for the long-term catheter user?

To explore the role of district nurses in caring for people with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease living in metropolitan London. Background. People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experience high symptom burden in their final stages of life. While the majority of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients symptoms are markedly similar to any end-stage chronic illness, these patients have limited access to supportive community services, such as district nursing. District nurses have an established role in end-of-life care in the community, however, this care has mainly focused on patients with terminal malignancy. It is unclear why district nurses established skills in end-of-life care not are not applied to this high needs patient group. Methods. A mixed-method design incorporating face-to-face interviews and mailed survey was chosen to gain a coherent understanding of the perceptions of district nurses in metropolitan London. Forty-three district nurses participated in this mixed method study in 2008. Conclusions. District nurses were found to lack confidence in their own knowledge about, and in their ability to interact with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. While district nurses did interact with these patients, this was limited to tasks unrelated to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Referrers appeared to misunderstand the district nurse role in end-stage care and therefore its application to the care of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients;Turner-Stokes, L., Disler, R., Shaw, A. & Williams, H. 2008, 'Screening for pain in patients with cognitive and communication difficulties: evaluation of the SPIN-screen', Clinical Medicine, vol. 8, no. 4, pp. 393-398.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Turner-Stokes, L., Disler, R. & Williams, H. 2007, 'The Rehabilitation Complexity Scale: a simple, practical tool to identify 'complex specialised' services in neurological rehabilitation', Clinical Medicine, vol. 7, no. 6, pp. 593-599.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Turner-Stokes, L., Disler, R. & Williams, H. 2007, 'Poster 13: Screening for Pain Using the Scale of Pain Intensity: A Pain Assessment Tool Designed for Patients With Cognitive and Communication Deficits Following Acquired Brain Injury', Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, vol. 88, pp. E13-E13.;Selected Peer-Assessed Projects;Lung Foundation Australia / Cochrane Airways Group small grant;University of California San Francisco, USA;University of Hull, UK;St Vincent's Hosptial Sydney;Shoalhaven Memorial District Hospital;about uts;The University;Facilities and maps;UTS governance;Faculties;Privacy statement;Disclaimer",

The 6MWT is known to be one of the most effective rehabilitation tests for a clinician to assess individuals with a variety of clinical conditions including survivors of a critical illness. Our method deploys body sensors for measuring health conditions and an on-body accelerometer for detecting motion. An intelligent algorithm was developed to detect a walk step, count the number of steps, and dynamically derive the step distance based on an individual's real-time walking parameters. The path and the derived walk distance are then related to their vital signs to assess their functional ability under various walk conditions. Our remote 6MWT is being considered for a telehealth rehabilitation procedure in an integrated assistive healthcare system. &&copy; 2012 IEEE.;Journal articles;Soo Hoo, S.Y., Gallagher, R. & Elliott, D. 2016, 'Field triage to primary percutaneous coronary intervention: Factors influencing health-related quality of life for patients aged?70 and 70 years with non-complicated ST-elevation myocardial infarction', Heart and Lung: Journal of Acute and Critical Care, vol. 45, no. 1, pp. 56-63.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;&&copy; 2016. Objective: To examine clinical and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes and predictors of HRQOL for uncomplicated field triage ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients aged?70 years and 70 years after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Background: Pre-hospital field triage for PPCI is associated with lower mortality but the impact of age and other factors on HRQOL remains unknown. Methods: 77 field triage STEMI patients were assessed for HRQOL using the Short Form-12 (SF-12) and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) at 4 weeks and 6 months after PPCI. Results: Regression analysis showed improvements in SF-12 domains and angina stability for older people. Age predicted lower physical function (. p = 0.001) and better SAQ QOL at 6 months (. p = 0.003). Conclusion: Age, length of hospitalization, recurrent angina and hypertension were important predictors of HRQOL with PPCI. Assessment of HRQOL combined with increased support for physical and emotional recovery is needed to improve clinical care for field triage PPCI patients.;McKinley, S., Fien, M., Elliott, R. & Elliott, D. 2016, 'Health-related quality of life and associated factors in intensive care unit survivors 6 months after discharge', American Journal of Critical Care, vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 52-58.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;&&copy; 2016 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. Background Intensive care unit survivors often have diminished health-related quality of life. Objectives To describe health-related quality of life of former intensive care patients and identify associated factors 6 months after hospital discharge. Methods Six months after discharge, 193 patients from an intensive care unit completed the Short Form-36 Health Survey, measures of sleep, Intensive Care Experience Questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist. Norm-based scores were calculated for the Short Form-36. Bivariate associations with Short Form-36 scores were tested by using the Pearson correlation. Multiple linear regression was used to identify independent associations with health-related quality of life. Results All scores on the Short Form-36 (physical component summary, 41.8, mental component summary, 48.2) were less than population norms. Bivariate associations with health-related quality of life (P.05) were scores on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, hospital length of stay, awareness of surroundings and frightening experiences, depression, anxiety, stress, posttraumatic symptoms, and sleep quality at 2 and 6 months. In linear regression, scores on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, hospital length of stay, and sleep quality at 6 months were independently associated with Short Form-36 physical summary scores (P.001), depression and stress were independently associated with mental summary scores (P.001). Conclusion Sleep, depression, and stress are potential targets for interventions to improve health-related quality of life and improve recovery.;Yeng, S.H.S., Gallagher, R. & Elliott, D. 2016, 'Factors influencing health-related quality of life after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction', Applied Nursing Research, vol. 30, pp. 237-244.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Soo Hoo, S.Y., Gallagher, R. & Elliott, D. 2016, 'Predictors of cardiac rehabilitation attendance following primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Australia.', Nurs Health Sci.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Cardiac rehabilitation is an important component of recovery and secondary prevention following urgent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. However, attendance and factors that predict participation by patients admitted with ST-elevation myocardial infarction remain unclear. This Australian study was conducted using a descriptive, comparative design. Consecutive patients (n?=?246) at two hospitals were interviewed by telephone at four weeks and six months. Open-ended questions were used to assess cardiac rehabilitation attendance, sociodemographics, modifiable risk factors, clinical outcomes, and post-discharge health support. Post-discharge home visits at four weeks (odds ratio: 2.64, 95% confidence interval: 1.48-4.71) and at six months were associated with better cardiac rehabilitation attendance, more males participated at four weeks and at six months.

All rights reserved. Background: Optimising clinical responses to deteriorating patients is an international indicator of acute healthcare quality. Observation charts incorporating track and trigger systems are an initiative to improve early identification and response to clinical deterioration. A suite of track and trigger 'Observation and Response Charts' were designed in Australia and initially tested in simulated environments. This paper reports initial clinical user experiences and views following implementation of these charts in adult general medical-surgical wards. Methods: Across eight trial sites, 44 focus groups were conducted with 218 clinical ward staff, mostly nurses, who received training and had used the charts in routine clinical practice for the preceding 2-6 weeks. Transcripts of audio recordings were analysed for emergent themes using an inductive approach. Findings: In this exploration of initial user experiences, key emergent themes were: tensions between vital sign 'ranges versus precision' to support decision making, using a standardised 'generalist chart in a range of specialist practice' areas, issues of 'clinical credibility', 'professional autonomy' and 'influences of doctors' when communicating abnormal signs, and 'permission and autonomy' when escalating care according to the protocol. Across themes, participants presented a range of positive, negative or mixed views. Benefits were identified despite charts not always being used up to their optimal design function. Participants reported tensions between chart objectives and clinical practices, revealing mismatches between design characteristics and human staff experiences. Overall, an initial view of 'increased activity/uncertain benefit' was uncovered. Conclusions: Findings particularly reinforced the significant influences of organisational work-based cultures, disciplinary boundaries and interdisciplinary communication on implementation of this new pr...;Varndell, W., Elliott, D. & Fry, M. 2015, 'Assessing, monitoring and managing continuous intravenous sedation for critically ill adult patients and implications for emergency nursing practice: A systematic literature review', Australasian Emergency Nursing Journal, vol. 18, no. 2, pp. 59-67.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;&&copy; 2014 College of Emergency Nursing Australasia Ltd. Background: Critically ill mechanically ventilated patients in ED have complex needs, chief among these is adequate sedation in addition to effective pain-relief. Emergency nurses are increasingly responsible sedation and analgesia for this complex cohort of patients. The aim of this review was to examine (1) the evidence around assessing, monitoring and managing continuous intravenous sedation for critically ill adult patients, and (2) the implications for emergency nursing practice. Study design: Systematic review. Method: The review of literature extended from 1946 to 2013 and examined peer review journal articles, policy and guidelines to provide a more complex understanding of a phenomenon of concern. A total of 98 articles were incorporated and comprehensively examined. Results: Analysis of the literature identified several implications for emergency nursing practice and the management of continuous intravenous sedation: workload, education, monitoring and assessing sedation and policy. Conclusion: Limited literature was found that directly addressed Australasian emergency nursing practices' in managing on-going intravenous sedation and analgesia for patients. Balancing patient sedation and analgesia requires highly complex knowledge, skills and expertise, the degree of education and training required is above that obtained during pre-registration nurse training. No state or national models of education or training were identified to support ED nurses' practices in managing sedation. Little research has addressed the safety of continuous sedation use in ED.;Allen, E., Jackson, D. & Elliott, D. 2015, 'Exploring interprofessional practices in rapid response systems: A case study protocol', Nurse Researcher, vol. 22, no. 3, pp. 20-27.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Aim To describe the development of a proposed case study protocol investigating interprofessional relationships in a rapid response system (RRS) in a socioculturally complex clinical environment. Background Suboptimal care of deteriorating ward patients remains a concern for many acute healthcare organisations. Despite the advent of RRSs, emergency response teams are not always used to their full potential. How and why interprofessional relationships influence practices associated with the care and management of ward patients at risk of clinical deterioration requires investigation. Data sources Theoretical and empirical literature describing case study research and RRSs. Review methods An integrative review approach of the literature, focusing on key terms relating to 'case study research' and 'rapid response system', provided context and informed development of the study protocol. Discussion A single-site mixed-method instrumental case study protocol was developed using methodological triangulation and a multi-level model to examine interprofessional relationships between a broad range of stakeholders. Concurrent data collection and analysis will occur using document review of clinical scenarios, non-participant observations and semi-structured interviews. Conclusion Case study research is an effective method for investigating socioculturally complex clinical environments. A strength of this approach is the flexibility in the choice of methods, which allows the researcher to build the design most suitable for the subjects or phenomena being investigated. Although this flexibility may be considered a potential weakness, rigour can be achieved by application of the strategies described. Implications for research/practice Findings from this research will provide rich descriptive insights into RRS relationships and healthcare professional practices during day-to-day management of acute ward patients at risk of or experiencing clinical deterioration.

Background: Bowel management protocols have the potential to minimize complications for critically ill patients. Targeted implementation can increase the uptake of protocols by clinicians into practice. The theory of planned behaviour offers a framework in which to investigate clinicians' intention to perform the behaviour of interest. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of implementing a bowel management protocol on intensive care nursing and medical staffs' knowledge, attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, behaviour intentions, role perceptions and past behaviours in relation to three bowel management practices. Methods: A descriptive before and after survey using a self-administered questionnaire sent to nursing and medical staff working within three intensive care units before and after implementation of our bowel management protocol (pre: May - June 2008, post: Feb - May 2009). Results: Participants had significantly higher knowledge scores post-implementation of our protocol (pre mean score 17.6, post mean score 19.3, p = 0.004). Post-implementation there was a significant increase in: self-reported past behaviour (pre mean score 5.38, post mean score 7.11, p = 0.002) and subjective norms scores (pre mean score 3.62, post mean score 4.18, p = 0.016) for bowel assessment, and behaviour intention (pre mean score 5.22, post mean score 5.65, p = 0.048) for administration of enema. Conclusion: This evaluation, informed by the theory of planned behaviour, has provided useful insights into factors that influence clinician intentions to perform evidence-based bowel management practices in intensive care. Addressing factors such as knowledge, attitudes and beliefs can assist in targeting implementation strategies to positively affect clinician behaviour change. Despite an increase in clinicians' knowledge scores, our implementation strategy did not, however, significantly change clinician behaviour intentions for all thr...;Innes, K., Jackson, D., Plummer, V. & Elliott, D. 2015, 'Care of patients in emergency department waiting rooms - an integrative review', Journal of Advanced Nursing, vol. 71, no. 12, pp. 2702-2714.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;&&copy; 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Aim: To conduct an integrative review of primary research examining patient care roles introduced into emergency department waiting rooms. Background: Internationally, emergency departments are under pressure to meet increasing patient demand with limited resources. Several initiatives have been developed that incorporate a healthcare role in waiting rooms, to assess and initiate early interventions to decrease waiting times, detect patient deterioration and improve communication. The literature reporting these roles has not been systematically evaluated. Design: Integrative review. Data sources: Published English-language peer reviewed articles in CINAHL, Scopus, Medline and Web of Knowledge between 2003-2014. Review methods: Identified literature was evaluated using an integrative review framework, incorporating methodological critique and narrative synthesis of findings. Results: Six papers were included, with three waiting room roles identified internationally - clinical initiative nurse, Physician-Nurse Supplementary Assessment Team and clinical assistants. All roles varied in terms of definitions, scope, responsibilities and skill sets of individuals in the position. There was limited evidence that the roles decreased waiting times or improved patient care, especially during busy periods. Of note, staff members performing these roles require high-level therapeutic relationship and effective interpersonal skills with patients, family and staff. The role requires support from other staff, particularly during periods of high workload, for optimal functioning and effective patient care. Conclusion: Generalisations and practice recommendations are limited due to the lack of available literature. Further research is required to evaluate the impact emergency department waiting room roles have on patient outcomes and staff perspectives.;Conroy, K.M., Elliott, D. & Burrell, A.R. 2015, 'Testing the implementation of an electronic process-of-care checklist for use during morning medical rounds in a tertiary intensive care unit: a prospective before–after study', Annals of Intensive Care, vol. 5, no. 1.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;&&copy; 2015, Conroy et al. Background: To improve the delivery of important care processes in the ICU, morning ward round checklists have been implemented in a number of intensive care units (ICUs) internationally. Good quality evidence supporting their use as clinical support tools is lacking. With increased use of technology in clinical settings, integration of such tools into current work practices can be a challenge and requires evaluation. Having completed preliminary work revealing variations in practice and evidence supporting the construct validity of a process-of-care checklist, the need to develop, test and further validate an e(lectronic)-checklist in an ICU was identified. Methods: A prospective, before;8211#after study was conducted in a 19-bed general ICU within a tertiary hospital. Data collection occurred during baseline and intervention periods for 6&&nbsp;weeks each, with education and training conducted over a 4-week period prior to intervention. The e-checklist was used at baseline by ICU research nurses conducting post-ward round audits. During intervention, senior medical staff completed the e-checklist after patient assessments during the morning ward rounds, and research staff conducted post-ward round audits for validity testing (via concordance measurement). To examine changes in compliance over time, checklist-level data were analysed using generalised estimating equations that factored in confounding variables, and statistical process control charts were used to evaluate unit-level data. Established measures of concordance were used to evaluate e-checklist validity. Results: Compliance with each care component improved significantly over time, the largest improvement was for pain management (42% increase, adjusted odds ratio&&nbsp;=&&nbsp;23, p&&nbsp;&&nbsp;0.001), followed by glucose management (22% increase, p&&nbsp;&&nbsp;0.001) and head-of-bed elevation (19% increase, p&&nbsp;&&nbsp;0.001), both with odds ratios greater than 10.

Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to explore factors influencing practices in assessing, titrating and managing sedation for the critically ill intubated patients, from the perspective of emergency nurses. Background: The number of critically ill patients presenting to Australian public Emergency Departments has increased by over 30% since 1980. Emergency nurses are increasingly relied upon to manage sedation of critically ill intubated patients. There is little evidence within international literature relating to how emergency nurses accomplish this. Design: Descriptive qualitative study. Method: A purposive sample of 15 experienced emergency nurses participated in semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Transcribed data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The qualitative analysis yielded five themes: becoming the resuscitation nurse, becoming confident as the resuscitation nurse, communicating about sedation, visual cues and the vanishing act. The safety and quality of sedation experienced by critically ill intubated patients in ED was the responsibility of emergency nurses, yet uncertainties and barriers were evident. Conclusion: Patient continuity of care, including optimisation of comfort relies upon the knowledge, skills and expertise of the emergency nurse allocated to the resuscitation area. For most nurses transitioning into the resuscitation nurse role, it represents the first time they will have had contact with patients with highly complex needs and sedation. The use of self-directed clinical workbooks and supervised clinical practice alone may be insufficient to adequately prepare nurses for the spectrum of critically ill sedated patients managed in the resuscitation area, a situation made worse in the presence of poor team communication. Relevance to clinical practice: The findings of this study should assist in the development of policy and formal education of emergency nurses transitioning in...;Chan, K., Pfoh, E., Denehy, L., Elliott, D., Holland, A., Dinglas, V. & Needham, D. 2015, 'Construct validity and minimal important difference of 6-minute walk distance in survivors of acute respiratory failure', Chest, vol. 147, no. 5, pp. 1316-1326.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Elliott, D., Berney, S., Harrold, M. & Skinner, E. 2015, 'Key measurement and feasibility characteristics for choosing outcome measures in rehabilitation', Current Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Reports, vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 255-267.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Selection of appropriate outcome measures to;assess progress in physical rehabilitation across the complete;recovery continuum is essential but may pose challenges;in clinical practice.

Setting: Online survey software was used for checklist development. The prospective audit using the checklist was conducted in 10 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. Participants: Checklist development was conducted with members of a bi-national professional society for critical care physicians using a modified Delphi technique and survey. A 30-day audit of adult patients mechanically ventilated for 72 h. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Presence of items on the screening checklist, physician diagnosis of VAP, clinical characteristics, investigations, treatments and patient outcome. Results: AVAP checklist was developed with five items: decreasing gas exchange, sputum changes, chest X-ray infiltrates, inflammatory response, microbial growth. Of the 169 participants, 17% (n=29) demonstrated characteristics of VAP using the checklist. A similar proportion had an independent physician diagnosis (n=30), but in a different patient subset (only 17% of cases were identified by both methods). The VAP rate per 1000 mechanical ventilator days for the checklist and clinician diagnosis was 25.9 and 26.7, respectively. The item 'inflammatory response' was most associated with the first episode of physician-diagnosed VAP. Conclusions: VAP rates using the checklist and physician diagnosis were similar to ranges reported internationally and in Australia. Of note, different patients were identified with VAP by the checklist and physicians. While the checklist items may assist in identifying patients at risk of developing VAP, and demonstrates synergy with the recently developed Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines, dec...;Knowles, S., Mcinnes, E., Elliott, D., Hardy, J. & Middleton, S. 2014, 'Evaluation of the implementation of a bowel management protocol in intensive care: Effect on clinician practices and patient outcomes', Journal of Clinical Nursing, vol. 23, no. 5-6, pp. 716-730.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Aims and objectives: To evaluate the effect of a multifaceted implementation of a bowel management protocol on outcomes for intensive care patients, in particular the incidence of constipation and diarrhoea, and on clinicians' bowel management practices. Background: Complications associated with poor bowel management for critically ill patients result in adverse outcomes. Implementation of protocols requires strategies proven to change clinician behaviour. Design: Before and after study. Methods: Our bowel management protocol was implemented using three evidence-based elements: education sessions, printed educational materials in the form of a fact sheet and reminders. We retrospectively collected data from patients' medical records admitted at two time points within three Sydney metropolitan intensive care units (preimplementation, n = 101, postimplementation, n = 107). Results: No significant difference was found in the incidence of constipation and diarrhoea pre and postimplementation of the protocol. Seventy-two per cent (n = 73) of patients preimplementation and 70% (n = 75) of patients postimplementation experienced one or more episodes of constipation (bowels not open for 72 hours or greater), and 16% (n = 16) of patients preimplementation and 20% (n = 21) of patients postimplementation experienced one or more episodes of diarrhoea. There was a slight nonsignificant increase in bowel assessment on admission by medical officers postimplementation (pre, 47%, n = 48, post, 60%, n = 64). Conclusion: Targeted multifaceted implementation of a bowel management protocol did not have an impact on the incidence of constipation or diarrhoea for intensive care patients or on clinician practices. The lack of impact on patient outcomes may be due to clinicians' nonadherence to our bowel management protocol. Reasons clinicians' practices did not change may include the influences of clinical decision-making on behaviour.

Bibliometrics are an essential aspect of measuring academic and organizational performance. Aim. This review seeks to describe methods for measuring bibliometrics, identify the strengths and limitations of methodologies, outline strategies for interpretation, summarise evaluation of nursing and midwifery performance, identify implications for metric of evaluation, and specify the implications for nursing and midwifery and implications of social networking for bibliometrics and measures of individual performance. Method. A review of electronic databases CINAHL, Medline, and Scopus was undertaken using search terms such as bibliometrics, nursing, and midwifery. The reference lists of retrieved articles and Internet sources and social media platforms were also examined. Results. A number of well-established, formal ways of assessment have been identified, including h- and c-indices. Changes in publication practices and the use of the Internet have challenged traditional metrics of influence. Moreover, measuring impact beyond citation metrics is an increasing focus, with social media representing newer ways of establishing performance and impact. Conclusions. Even though a number of measures exist, no single bibliometric measure is perfect. Therefore, multiple approaches to evaluation are recommended. However, bibliometric approaches should not be the only measures upon which academic and scholarly performance are evaluated. &&copy; 2014 Patricia M.

Background: Emergency nurses are increasingly responsible for the ongoing assessment, monitoring and titration of continuous intravenous sedation, in addition to analgesia for the critically ill adult patient. One method to optimise patient sedation is to use a validated observational sedation-scoring tool. It is not clear however what the optimal instrument available is for use in this clinical context. Methods: A systematic literature review methodology was employed. A range of electronic databases were searched for the period 1946-2013. Search terms incorporated \"sedation scale\", \"sedation scoring system\", \"measuring sedation\", and \"sedation tool\" and were used to retrieve relevant literature. In addition, manual searches were conducted and articles retrieved from those listed in key papers. Articles were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) making sense of evidence tools. Results: A total of 27 observational sedation-scoring instruments were identified. Sedation-scoring instruments can be categorised as linear or composite, the former being the most common. A wide variety of patient behaviours are used within the instruments to measure depth and quality of patient sedation. Typically sedation-scoring instruments incorporated three patient behaviours, which were then rated to generate a numerical score. The majority of the instruments have been subjected to validity and reliability testing, however few have been examined for responsiveness or applicability.

An integrative literature review', Australian Critical Care, vol. 27, no. 4, pp. 157-164.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;&&copy; 2014 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd. Objective: To explore the association between patient volume in intensive care units (ICUs) and risk-adjusted mortality. Background: Large multi-speciality ICUs are emerging in response to increasing demand for critical care. Consolidation of resources through regionalisation of services aims to contain costs and optimise demand management and operational synergies. Higher patient volumes in ICU have been associated with improved outcomes. Limited evidence exists, however, to suggest an optimal volume of patients in terms of risk-adjusted mortality. Review method: Retrospective integrative literature review. Data sources: EMBASE, PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature electronic databases. Inclusion criteria: Primary studies of risk adjusted mortality in adult ICU patients published between 1995 and 2012. Exclusion criteria: Studies of admissions following elective procedures. Results: Twenty quantitative observational studies were included in this review. Studies were primarily retrospective with three conducted prospectively. Nine studied mechanically ventilated patients, six included all admissions to ICU, three reported on patients with sepsis and one study each on patients post cardiac arrest and those receiving renal replacement therapy. A significant association was evident in sixteen studies suggesting a lower risk of adjusted mortality in higher-volume units. The association was not consistent across all diagnosis. A non-linear relationship observed in two studies noted no mortality benefit occurring above a volume threshold of 450 cases annually per diagnostic category and above 711 cases not specific to a diagnostic group. Conclusion: Patient mortality may be improved in large capacity ICUs. However, the association is not consistent across all diagnostic groups. Risk adjusted mortality is increased in low volume ICUs.

Background: Clinical deterioration of adult patients in acute medical-surgical wards continues to occur, despite a range of systems and processes designed to minimize this risk. In Australia, a standardized template for adult observation charts using human factors design principles and decision-support characteristics was developed to improve the detection of and response to abnormal vital signs. Objective: To describe the study protocol for the clinical testing of these observation and response charts (ORCs). Methods: We propose a two-phase multisite multiple-methods design to test the initial clinical utility of the charts in 10 hospitals of differing types and sizes across state jurisdictions in Australia. Data collection in the first phase includes user surveys, observations and field notes by project officers, handover de-briefs (short interviews with small groups of staff), and an audit of ORC documentation completion compared to the site's existing observation chart. For the second phase, data will be collected using a retrospective audit of observation documentation from the previous hospital observation chart, prospective audit of observation documentation following implementation of the selected ORC, user focus groups, observational field notes, and patient outcome data from routinely collected organizational data sources. Results: Site selection and preparation, project officer training, chart selection and implementation, participant recruitment, and data collection has been completed and the analysis of these results are in progress.

Background: Increasing numbers of survivors of critical illness are at risk for physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that may persist for months or years after hospital discharge. The post-intensive care syndrome framework encompassing these multidimensional morbidities was developed at the 2010 Society of Critical Care Medicine conference on improving long-term outcomes after critical illness for survivors and their families. Objectives: To report on engagement with non-critical care providers and survivors during the 2012 Society of Critical Care Medicine post-intensive care syndrome stakeholder conference. Task groups developed strategies and resources required for raising awareness and education, understanding and addressing barriers to clinical practice, and identifying research gaps and resources, aimed at improving patient and family outcomes. Participants: Representatives from 21 professional associations or health systems involved in the provision of both critical care and rehabilitation of ICU survivors in the United States and ICU survivors and family members. Design: Stakeholder consensus meeting. Researchers presented summaries on morbidities for survivors and their families, whereas survivors presented their own experiences. Meeting Outcomes: Future steps were planned regarding 1) recognizing, preventing, and treating post-intensive care syndrome, 2) building strategies for institutional capacity to support and partner with survivors and families, and 3) understanding and addressing barriers to practice. There was recognition of the need for systematic and frequent assessment for post-intensive care syndrome across the continuum of care, including explicit \"functional reconciliation\" (assessing gaps between a patient's pre-ICU and current functional ability at all intra- and interinstitutional transitions of care).

People aged over 60 years represent an increasingly high proportion of the population undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. While risks are greater for older people in terms of major adverse cardiovascular events and higher mortality for this treatment, it is unclear if the benefits of health-related quality of life outcomes may outweigh risks. A search of the PubMed, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica, and Cochrane databases was conducted for the period from January 1999 to June 2012 using key words \"percutaneous coronary intervention\"/\"angioplasty,\" \"older,\" \"elderly,\" and \"quality of life\"/\"health-related quality of life.\" Using a systematic review approach, data from 18 studies were extracted for description and synthesis. Findings revealed that everyone regardless of age reported better health-related quality of life, primarily from the relief of angina and improved physical and mental function. Age itself did not have an independent predictive effect when other factors such as comorbid conditions were taken into account. Assessment of older peoples' health status following percutaneous coronary intervention by nurses and other health professionals is therefore important for the provision of quality care.;Rolls, K.D., Hansen, M., Jackson, D. & Elliott, D. 2014, 'Analysis of the social network development of a virtual community for Australian intensive care professionals', CIN - Computers Informatics Nursing, vol. 32, no. 11, pp. 536-544.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Copyright &&copy; 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Social media platforms can create virtual communities, enabling healthcare professionals to network with a broad range of colleagues and facilitate knowledge exchange. In 2003, an Australian state health department established an intensive care mailing list to address the professional isolation experienced by senior intensive care nurses. This article describes the social network created within this virtual community by examining how the membership profile evolved from 2003 to 2009. A retrospective descriptive design was used. The data source was a deidentifiedmember database. Since 2003, 1340 healthcare professionals subscribed to the virtual community with 78% of these (n = 1042) still members at the end of 2009. The membership profile has evolved from a single-state nurse-specific network to an Australia-wide multidisciplinary and multiorganizational intensive care network. The uptake and retention of membership by intensive care clinicians indicated that they appeared to value involvement in this virtual community. For healthcare organizations, a virtual community may be a communications option for minimizing professional and organizational barriers and promoting knowledge flow. Further research is, however, required to demonstrate a link between these broader social networks, enabling the exchange of knowledge and improved patient outcomes.;Varndell, W., Elliott, D. & Fry, M. 2014, 'Emergency nurses practices in assessing and administering continuous intravenous sedation for critically ill adult patients: A retrospective record review'', International Emergency Nursing.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Aim: To generate an initial profile of emergency nurses' practices in and factors influencing the assessment and administration of continuous intravenous sedation and analgesia for critically ill mechanically ventilated adult patients. Background: Emergency nurses are relied upon to assess and manage critically ill patients, some of whom require continuous intravenous sedation. Balancing sedation is a highly complex activity. There is however little evidence relating to how emergency nurses manage continuous intravenous analgesia and sedation for the critically ill intubated patients. Design: Descriptive study. Method: A 12-month retrospective medical record review was undertaken from January to December 2009 of patients (16 years) administered continuous intravenous sedation in ED. Results: Fifty-five patients received ongoing intravenous sedation within the ED during a median length of stay of 3.4 h. Assessment of patient depth/quality of sedation and pain-relief varied and were rarely documented. Adverse events were documented, majority (16%) drug administration related. Thematic analysis identified three themes: 'Maintaining sedation', 'Directionless-directions', and 'Navigating the balance'. Conclusion: Emergency nurses provide continuity of patient care and optimisation of analgesia and sedation for critically ill sedated patients. The safety and effectiveness of continuous intravenous sedation for the critically ill adult patient in ED are dependent on the expertise and decision-making abilities of the nurse.;Knowles, S., Lam, L.T.-.M., McInnes, E., Hardy, J., Elliott, D. & Middleton, S. 2014, 'Predictors of intensive care clinicians' behaviour intention for three bowel management practices', Australian Critical Care, vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 45-45.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Hodgson, C.L., Stiller, K., Needham, D.M., Tipping, C.J., Harrold, M., Baldwin, C.E., Bradley, S., Berney, S., Caruana, L.R., Elliott, D., Green, M., Haines, K., Higgins, A.M., Kaukonen, K.M., Leditschke, I.A., Nickels, M.R., Paratz, J., Patman, S., Skinner, E.H., Young, P.J., Zanni, J.M., Denehy, L. & Webb, S.A. 2014, 'Expert consensus and recommendations on safety criteria for active mobilization of mechanically ventilated critically ill adults', Critical Care, vol. 18, no. 6.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;&&copy; 2014 Hodgson et al., licensee BioMed Central. Introduction: The aim of this study was to develop consensus recommendations on safety parameters for mobilizing adult, mechanically ventilated, intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: A systematic literature review was followed by a meeting of 23 multidisciplinary ICU experts to seek consensus regarding the safe mobilization of mechanically ventilated patients. Results: Safety considerations were summarized in four categories: respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and other. Consensus was achieved on all criteria for safe mobilization, with the exception being levels of vasoactive agents. Intubation via an endotracheal tube was not a contraindication to early mobilization and a fraction of inspired oxygen less than 0.6 with a percutaneous oxygen saturation more than 90% and a respiratory rate less than 30 breaths/minute were considered safe criteria for in- and out-of-bed mobilization if there were no other contraindications. At an international meeting, 94 multidisciplinary ICU clinicians concurred with the proposed recommendations. Conclusion: Consensus recommendations regarding safety criteria for mobilization of adult, mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU have the potential to guide ICU rehabilitation whilst minimizing the risk of adverse events.;Conroy, K.M., Elliott, D. & Burrell, A.R. 2013, 'Validating a process-of-care checklist for intensive care units', Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 342-348.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Early evidence suggests that checklists are one way of ensuring required processes of care are delivered to intensive care unit patients. Evidence to date however, has not explicitly detailed methods of checklist validation in these settings. This study aimed to test the validity of a 'process-of-care' checklist for measuring and ensuring daily care delivery in an intensive care unit. A retrospective audit of a random selection of patient medical records was undertaken to compare with checklist data completed during the same time frame. Documentation in the patients' medical records was used as a proxy measure for actual completion of care. A specific audit tool extracted information from both the checklist and the medical record on the following processes of care: nutrition, weaning from ventilation, pain, glucose control, sit out of bed, bowel management, deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis. These two data sources were compared using the Spearman's rho correlation coefficient. The two forms of documentation were significantly correlated (P=0.01) for all but one of the checklist items (pain). Findings provided support for the concurrent validity of an intensive care unit process-of-care checklist. Further research is required for checklist validity and reliability testing prior to, or in conjunction with, a planned prospective intervention study.;Elliott, D., Aitken, L.M., Bucknall, T.K., Seppelt, I.M., Webb, S.A.R., Weisbrodt, L. & McKinley, S. 2013, 'Patient comfort in the intensive care unit: A multicentre, binational point prevalence study of analgesia, sedation and delirium management', Critical Care and Resuscitation, vol. 15, no. 3, pp. 213-219.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Objective: To measure the prevalence of assessment and management practices for analgesia, sedation and delirium in patients in Australian and New Zealand intensive care units. Materials and methods: We developed survey items from a modified Delphi panel and included them in a binational, point prevalence study. We used a standard case report form to capture retrospective patient data on management of analgesia, sedation and delirium at the end of a 4-hour period on the study day. Other data were collected during independent assessment of patient status and medication requirements. Results: Data were collected on 569 patients in 41 ICUs. Pain assessment was documented in the 4 hours before study observation in 46% of patients. Of 319 assessable patients, 16% had moderate pain and 6% had severe pain. Routine sedation assessment using a scale was recorded in 63% of intubated and ventilated patients. When assessed, 38% were alert and calm, or drowsy and rousable, 22% were lightly to moderately sedated, 31% were deeply sedated (66% of these had a documented indication), and 9% were agitated or restless. Sedatives were titrated to a target level in 42% of patients. Routine assessment of delirium occurred in 3%, and at study assessment 9% had delirium. Wrist or arm restraints were used for 7% of patients. Conclusions: Only two-thirds of sedated patients had their sedation levels formally assessed, half had pain assessed and very few had formal assessment of delirium. Our description of current practices, and other observational data, may help in planning further research in this area.;McKinley, S. & Elliott, D. 2013, 'Twenty-five years of critical care nursing scholarship in Australia', Australian Critical Care, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 7-11.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Background: Australian Critical Care has been published since 1988 and has been an important medium for the development of critical care nursing scholarship in Australia over 25 years. Purpose: To review scholarship in critical care nursing in Australia since 1988 and record its progress in the context of developments in nursing education and intensive and critical care practice. Approach: Australian Critical Care issues since 1988 were reviewed, and abstracts from the Australian and New Zealand Annual Scientific Meeting on Intensive Care published in Australian Critical Care since the 1991 Meeting. Available evidence for the contribution of this body of scholarship to critical care nursing practice and patient care was considered. Results: Original research reports and review articles have steadily increased from 1988 to 2012. The peak years for research publications were 2001, 2005 and 2012, and for reviews 2010 and 2011. Approximately 760 abstracts were presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting from 1991 to 2010, overall 24% were found lead to peer-reviewed publications, with an increase to 30% in recent years. Summary: Over 25 years, the scholarship of critical care nursing in Australia has evolved into an established area of disciplinary knowledge, based firmly in practice. Our discipline has witnessed the opportunity for PhD training, the introduction of professorial positions, a knowledge base built on original research and rigorous reviews, and sustainable dissemination. The challenges are to further strengthen this development, increase publication of research that is done, to demonstrate the influence on practice and to develop sustainable research funding. &&copy; 2012 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.;McKinley, S., Fien, M., Elliott, R. & Elliott, D. 2013, 'Sleep and psychological health during early recovery from critical illness: An observational study', Journal of Psychosomatic Research, vol. 75, no. 6, pp. 539-545.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Introduction: Intensive care patients often report sleep disruption in ICU and during recovery from critical illness. Objectives: To assess: (i) patients' self-reported sleep quality in ICU, on the hospital ward after transfer from ICU and two and six months after hospital discharge, (ii) whether patients who report sleep disruption in ICU continue to report sleep disruption in recovery and (iii) whether prehospital insomnia, experiences in intensive care, quality of life and psychological health are associated with sleep disruption six months after hospital discharge. Methods: Patients completed self-report measures on sleep quality at five time points: prior to hospitalization, in ICU, the hospital ward, two months and six months after hospital discharge, their intensive care experiences two months after discharge and psychological health and quality of life six months after discharge. Results: Patients (n. = 222) were aged (mean. &&plusmn;. SD) 57.2. &&plusmn;. 17.2. years, 35% female, had mean ICU stay of 5. &&plusmn;. 6. days and BMI of 26. &&plusmn;. 5. Over half the participants (57%) reported poor sleep at six months, for 10% this was at all time points after ICU admission. Prehospitalization insomnia (p. =.0005), sleep quality on the ward (p. =.006), anxiety (p. =.002), and mental (p. =.0005) and physical health (p. =.0005) were independently associated with poorer sleep quality in survivors six months after ICU treatment. Conclusions: Sleep is a significant issue for more than half of survivors 6. months after ICU treatment. Some influencing factors, such as hospital sleep quality, anxiety, physical health and mental health, are potentially modifiable and should be targeted in recovery programs. &&copy; 2013 Elsevier Inc.;Conroy, K.M., Elliott, D. & Burrell, A.R. 2013, 'Developing content for a process-of-care checklist for use in intensive care units: A dual-method approach to establishing construct validity', BMC Health Services Research, vol. 13, no. 1.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: In the intensive care unit (ICU), checklists can be used to support the delivery of quality and consistent clinical care. While studies have reported important benefits for clinical checklists in this context, lack of formal validity testing in the literature prompted the study aim, to develop relevant 'process-of-care' checklist statements, using rigorously applied and reported methods that were clear, concise and reflective of the current evidence base. These statements will be sufficiently instructive for use by physicians during ICU clinical rounds. Methods. A dual-method approach was utilized, semi-structured interviews with local clinicians, and rounds of surveys to an expert Delphi panel. The interviews helped determine checklist item inclusion/exclusion prior to the first round Delphi survey. The panel for the modified-Delphi technique consisted of local intensivists and a state-wide ICU quality committee. Minimum standards for consensus agreement were set prior to the distribution of questionnaires, and rounds of surveys continued until consensus was achieved. Results: A number of important issues such as overlap with other initiatives were identified in interviews with clinicians and integrated into the Delphi questionnaire, but no additional checklist items were suggested, demonstrating adequate checklist coverage sourced from the literature. These items were verified by local clinicians as being relevant to ICU and important elements of care that required checking during ward rounds. Two rounds of Delphi surveys were required to reach consensus on nine checklist statements: nutrition, pain management, sedation, deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention, head-of-bed elevation, blood glucose levels, readiness to extubate, and medications. Conclusions: Statements were developed as the most clear, concise, evidence-informed and instructive statements for use during clinical rounds in an ICU.

These intensive care survivors and their families frequently report a wide range of impairments in their health status which may last for months and years after hospital discharge. Objectives: To report on a 2-day Society of Critical Care Medicine conference aimed at improving the long-term outcomes after critical illness for patients and their families. Participants: Thirty-one invited stakeholders participated in the conference. Stakeholders represented key professional organizations and groups, predominantly from North America, which are involved in the care of intensive care survivors after hospital discharge. Design: Invited experts and Society of Critical Care Medicine members presented a summary of existing data regarding the potential long-term physical, cognitive and mental health problems after intensive care and the results from studies of postintensive care unit interventions to address these problems. Stakeholders provided reactions, perspectives, concerns and strategies aimed at improving care and mitigating these long-term health problems. Measurements and Main Results, Three major themes emerged from the conference regarding: (1) raising awareness and education, (2) understanding and addressing barriers to practice, and (3) identifying research gaps and resources. Postintensive care syndrome was agreed upon as the recommended term to describe new or worsening problems in physical, cognitive, or mental health status arising after a critical illness and persisting beyond acute care hospitalization. The term could be applied to either a survivor or family member. Conclusions: Improving care for intensive care survivors and their families requires collaboration between practitioners and researchers in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Strategies were developed to address the major themes arising from the conference to improve outcomes for survivors and famili...;Alison, J.A., Kenny, P., King, M.T., Mckinley, S., Aitken, L.M., Leslie, G.D. & Elliott, D. 2012, 'Repeatability of the six-minute walk test and relation to physical function in survivors of a critical illness', Physical Therapy, vol. 92, no. 12, pp. 1556-1563.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background. The Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is widely used as an outcome measure in exercise rehabilitation. However, the repeatability of the 6MWT performed at home in survivors of a critical illness has not been evaluated. Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in survivors of a critical illness: (1) the repeatability of the 6MWT performed at home, (2) the effect on estimates of change in functional exercise capacity if only one 6MWT was performed at follow-up assessments, and (3) the relationship between the physical functioning (PF) score of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) and the 6MWT. Design. Repeated measures of the 6MWT and SF-36 were obtained. Methods. Eligible participants had an intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay of?48 hours and were mechanically ventilated for?24 hours. Two 6MWTs and the SF-36 were conducted in participants' homes at weeks 1, 8, and 26 after hospital discharge. Results. One hundred seventy-three participants completed the study. The participants had a mean age of 57 years (SD=16), a mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score on admission of 19 (SD=10), a mean ICU length of stay of 9 days (SD=8), and a mean mechanical ventilation time of 140 hours (SD=137). Of the 173 participants, 110 performed two 6MWTs at weeks 1, 8, and 26. There were significant mean increases in 6-minute walk distance in the second test of 15 m (P.0001) at week 1, 13 m (P.0001) at week 8, and 9 m (P=.04) at week 26. If only one 6MWT was performed at weeks 8 and 26, the estimate of change in 6-minute walk distance from week 1 was 19 m less (P.001) at both weeks 8 and 26. There was a moderate to strong correlation between SF-36 PF score and 6-minute walk distance at each assessment (week 1: r=.62, P.001, week 8: r=.55, P.001, and week 26: r=.47, P.001). Limitations. Some study participants were unable to perform a second 6MWT, and these participants may have differed in important...;Connolly, B., Denehy, L., Brett, S., Elliott, D. & Hart, N. 2012, 'Exercise rehabilitation following hospital discharge in survivors of critical illness: An integrative review', Critical Care, vol. 16, no. 3.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Although clinical trials have shown benefit from early rehabilitation within the ICU, rehabilitation of patients following critical illness is increasingly acknowledged as an area of clinical importance. However, despite recommendations from published guidelines for rehabilitation to continue following hospital discharge, there is limited evidence to underpin practice during this intermediate stage of recovery. Those patients with ICU-acquired weakness on discharge from the ICU are most likely to benefit from ongoing rehabilitation. Despite this, screening based on strength alone may fail to account for the associated level of physical functioning, which may not correlate with muscle strength, nor address non-physical complications of critical illness. The aim of this review was to consider which patients are likely to require rehabilitation following critical illness and to perform an integrative review of the available evidence of content and nature of exercise rehabilitation programmes for survivors of critical illness following hospital discharge. Literature databases and clinical trials registries were searched using appropriate terms and groups of terms. Inclusion criteria specified the reporting of rehabilitation programmes for patients following critical illness post-hospital discharge. Ten items, including data from published studies and protocols from trial registries, were included. Because of the variability in study methodology and inadequate level of detail of reported exercise prescription, at present there can be no clear recommendations for clinical practice from this review. As this area of clinical practice remains in its relative infancy, further evidence is required both to identify which patients are most likely to benefit and to determine the optimum content and format of exercise rehabilitation programmes for patients following critical illness post-hospital discharge. &&copy; 2012 BioMed Central Ltd.;McKinley, S., Aitken, L.M., Alison, J.A., King, M., Leslie, G., Burmeister, E. & Elliott, D. 2012, 'Sleep and other factors associated with mental health and psychological distress after intensive care for critical illness', Intensive Care Medicine, vol. 38, no. 4, pp. 627-633.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Purpose: Some patients who survive intensive care unit (ICU) treatment report psychological sequelae during recovery. This study examined factors associated with psychological outcomes of former ICU patients up to 6 months after hospital discharge. Methods: Participants (n = 195) were adult survivors of ICU enrolled in a multicenter trial of physical rehabilitation after hospital discharge. The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Impact of Events Scale (IES) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales were completed, and sleep rated on a five-point scale at weeks 1, 8 and 26, clinical and demographic data were obtained from patient records. Results: Participants were 41% females with mean &&plusmn; standard deviation (SD) age of 57 &&plusmn; 16 years and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores of 19 &&plusmn; 7, median lengths of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay were 89 h and 6 days, respectively. Impaired mental health, depression, anxiety, stress and psychological distress significantly improved after week 1. Female gender, younger age and sleeping problems were associated with impaired psychological outcomes on bivariate analyses. Age, gender, week 1 anxiety, depression and stress, week 26 sleeping, and rehabilitation study group were entered into multiple linear regression analyses for week 26 IES and SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) outcomes. IES scores were associated (p\\0.05) with gender, week 1 stress and week 26 sleep but not study group, MCS scores were associated (p\\0.05) with week 1 stress and week 26 sleep but not study group. Conclusion: Female gender, early levels of increased stress and problems sleeping are associated with worse psychological recovery for survivors of critical illness.&&copy; Copyright jointly held by Springer and ESICM 2012.;Stewart, A.M., Baker, J.D. & Elliott, D. 2012, 'The psychological wellbeing of patients following excision of a pilonidal sinus', Journal of Wound Care, vol. 21, no. 12, pp. 595-600.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Objective: To explore the effects of a pilonidal sinus wound on patients' psychological wellbeing. Method: An interpretive descriptive approach, using the model of living conceptual framework, guided data collection and analysis. The model of living was chosen to elicit information on how a pilonidal sinus wound affected activities of living. Participants were recruited from a database of a community nursing service, using purposive sampling, until data saturation was evident. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data. Data were examined for frequent patterns, which were organised into themes. results: Seven males and four females with ages ranging 17-39 years were selected through purposive sampling. Five participants reported that their wound affected their psychological wellbeing. Three themes and eight subthemes were identified from the data: adaption, perception and control. Depression and stress were associated with pain, physical inactivity, body weight changes and delayed wound healing. conclusion: A pilonidal sinus wound can affect the psychological wellbeing of patients through pain, physical inactivity, changed body weight and delayed wound healing.

In this review, we discuss recent studies that inform our developing understanding for improving the recovery trajectory for survivors of a critical illness during the postintensive care and posthospital periods. Recent findings New studies, although at this stage often presented as pilot work, provide important beginning messages for improving recovery from a critical illness. Some pilot studies demonstrate promise of effective interventions, whereas other studies offer useful baseline information for improving the power of tested interventions. Summary Innovative rehabilitation and recovery strategies during the postintensive care and posthospital periods are now being published. Further research with larger sample sizes, well-documented usual care and intervention arms and in different critical illness cohorts is required to demonstrate the optimal approaches for screening, implementation, outcome assessment and follow-up periods for rehabilitation interventions in the postintensive care phase of a patient's recovery.

Studies have demonstrated debilitating physical effects for a significant proportion of surviving patients, particularly those with intensive care unit-acquired weakness. Contemporary practice changes include a focus on the continuum of critical illness, with less sedation and more physical activity including mobility while in ICU, and post-ICU and post-hospitalisation activities to support optimal recovery. How to best assess the physical function of patients at different phases of their recovery and rehabilitation is therefore important. Purpose: This narrative review paper examined observational and functional assessment instruments used for assessing patients across the in-ICU, post-ICU and post-hospital continuum of critical illness. Methods: Relevant papers were identified from a search of bibliographic databases and a review of the reference list of selected articles. The clinimetric properties of physical function and HRQOL measures and their relevance and utility in ICU were reported in narrative format. Findings: The review highlighted many different instruments used to measure function in survivors of ICU including muscle strength testing, functional tests and walk tests, and patient centred outcomes such as health related quality of life. In general, the sensitivity and validity of these instruments for use with survivors of a critical illness has not yet been established. Conclusion: Based on findings from the review, screening of patients using reliable and valid instruments for ICU patients is recommended to inform both practice and future studies of interventions aimed at improving recovery and rehabilitation. &&copy; 2011 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.;Hewson-Conroy, K.M., Burrell, A.R., Elliott, D., Webb, S.A.R., Seppelt, I.M., Taylor, C. & Glass, P. 2011, 'Compliance with processes of care in intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand - A point prevalence study', Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, vol. 39, no. 5, pp. 926-935.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;There are indications that compliance with routine clinical practices in intensive care units (ICU) varies widely internationally, but it is currently unknown whether this is the case throughout Australia and New Zealand. A one-day point prevalence study measured the prevalence of routine care processes being delivered in Australian and New Zealand ICUs including the assessment and/or management of: nutrition, pain, sedation, weaning from mechanical ventilation, head of bed elevation, deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, blood glucose, pressure areas and bowel action. Using a sample of 50 adult ICUs, prevalence data were collected for 662 patients with a median age of 65 years and a median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 18. Wide variations in compliance were evident in several care components including: assessment of nutritional goals (74%, interquartile range [IQR] 51 to 89%), pain score (35%, IQR 17 to 62%), sedation score (89%, IQR 50 to 100%), care of ventilated patients e.g. head of bed elevation 30 degrees (33%, IQR 7 to 62%) and setting weaning plans (50%, IQR 28 to 78%), pressure area risk assessment (78%, IQR 18 to 100%) and constipation management plan (43%, IQR 6 to 87%). Care components that were delivered more consistently included nutrition delivery (100%, IQR 100 to 100%), deep venous thrombosis (96%, IQR 89 to 100%) and stress ulcer (90%, IQR 78 to 100%) prophylaxis, and checking blood sugar levels (93%, IQR 88 to 100%). This point prevalence study demonstrated variability in the delivery of 'routine' cares in Australian and New Zealand ICUs. This may be driven in part by lack of consensus on what is best practice in intensive care units, prompting the need for further research in this area.;Elliott, D., McKinley, S., Alison, J., Aitken, L.M., King, M., Leslie, G.D., Kenny, P., Taylor, P., Foley, R. & Burmeister, E. 2011, 'Health-related quality of life and physical recovery after a critical illness: A multi-centre randomised controlled trial of a home-based physical rehabilitation program', Critical Care, vol. 15, no. 3.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Introduction: Significant physical sequelae exist for some survivors of a critical illness. There are, however, few studies that have examined specific interventions to improve their recovery, and none have tested a home-based physical rehabilitation program incorporating trainer visits to participants' homes. This study was designed to test the effect of an individualised eight-week home-based physical rehabilitation program on recovery.Methods: A multi-centre randomised controlled trial design was used. Adult intensive care patients (length of stay of at least 48 hours and mechanically ventilated for 24 hours or more) were recruited from 12 Australian hospitals between 2005 and 2008. Graded, individualised endurance and strength training intervention was prescribed over eight weeks, with three physical trainer home visits, four follow-up phone calls, and supported by a printed exercise manual. The main outcome measures were blinded assessments of physical function, SF-36 physical function (PF) scale and six-minute walk test (6MWT), and health-related quality of life (SF-36) conducted at 1, 8 and 26 weeks after hospital discharge.Results: Of the 195 participants randomised, 183, 173 and 161 completed the 1, 8 and 26 weeks assessments, respectively. Study groups were similar at Week 1 post-hospital, for the intervention and control groups respectively, mean norm-based PF scores were 27 and 29 and the 6MWT distance was 291 and 324 metres. Both groups experienced significant and clinically important improvements in PF scores and 6MWT distance at 8 weeks, which persisted at 26 weeks. Mixed model analysis showed no significant group effects (P = 0.84) or group by time interactions (P = 0.68) for PF. Similar results were found for 6MWT and the SF-36 summary scores.Conclusions: This individualised eight-week home-based physical rehabilitation program did not increase the underlying rate of recovery in this sample, with both groups of critically ill survivors improving...;Stewart, A.M., Baker, J.D. & Elliott, D. 2011, 'The effects of a sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus wound on activities of living: Thematic analysis of participant interviews', Journal of Clinical Nursing, vol. 20, no. 21-22, pp. 3174-3182.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Aims and objective. To describe the effects sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus wounds had on participants' activities of living. Background. A sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus commonly occurs in healthy young people and is associated with considerable morbidity and discomfort. Surgery is frequently required, and patients are often discharged home with large open wounds. Most research has addressed the technical aspects of surgery and treatment. Design. An interpretive descriptive approach guided by The Model of Living framework. Methods. Purposive sampling was used to recruit four women and seven men, age range 17-39years, from a metropolitan hospital in NSW, Australia. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews that were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Results. Three themes and eight subthemes emerged from the analysis: (1) 'Adaption' included subthemes, learning to live with the wound, difficulty living with the wound and living life despite the wound, (2) 'Perception' embraced subthemes, embarrassment, lack of understanding and changed body image, and (3) 'Control' included subthemes, loss of control and gaining control. Participants whose pain was not managed, who were unprepared for the postoperative recovery at home or experienced delayed wound healing had most difficulty with activities of living. Conclusions. This research gives some insight into the pilonidal wound experience from the person's perspective. All activities of living were affected by the pilonidal sinus wound. The effect was variable and influenced by pain, embarrassment and a general lack of understanding about the condition and the care of the wound. The specific wound location was an underlying factor causing problems for participants. Relevance to clinical practice. Individualised care will help in reducing discomfort and improving life experiences following surgery.

Aim: To identify existence of current guidelines and informal routine procedures and clinicians' views of same within New South Wales (NSW) Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and High Dependency Units (HDUs) for 11 practice areas, namely, bowel management, endotracheal tube (ETT) stabilisation, tracheostomy tube stabilisation, feeding, analgesia, sedation, thromboembolic prevention, head of bed elevation, ulcer prophylaxis and glucose control. Method: A telephone survey conducted with a representative from NSW ICUs and HDUs. Results: There was variation in the number of guidelines and informal routine procedures reported for the 11 practice areas within the study units. Larger ICUs (Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine Level II and Level III) and those who employed an onsite CNC were significantly more likely to have formal guidelines in place. Overall, there were very few audits reportedly conducted for the 11 practice areas. Bowel management was the area of practice most respondents reported as a neglected area of critical care nursing practice and the one they were least satisfied with. Conclusion: This survey provides a baseline of current practice and guideline use within NSW ICUs and HDUs. It also highlights areas for consideration to further develop clinical practice guidelines that could benefit critically ill patients. &&copy; 2009 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.;Hewson-Conroy, K.M., Elliott, D. & Burrell, A.R. 2010, 'Quality and safety in intensive care-A means to an end is critical', Australian Critical Care, vol. 23, no. 3, pp. 109-129.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: To achieve improvement in healthcare quality and safety, all four domains (outcome, process, structure and culture) must be considered in conjunction with the best available clinical evidence to improve patient care and reduce harm. A range of improvement initiatives have targeted processes of care in recognition of: (1) complexities of patient care and (2) evidence that a large portion of adverse events are preventable, occur during ongoing care, and result in poorer patient outcomes. Purpose: The aims of this paper are to: (1) outline national and international quality and safety initiatives, (2) identify evidence-based processes of care applicable to the general adult ICU patient population, (3) summarise the literature on relevant quality improvement strategies. Methods: An integrative literature review was conducted by: (1) database search of Ovid Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and Cochrane for articles published between 1996 and October 2009, (2) identification of additional studies from articles obtained, (3) purposive internet search identifying relevant quality and safety initiatives. Findings: Quality improvement initiatives across the globe were identified, with ensuing focus on how the development, implementation and evaluation of evidence-based processes of care can lead to improvements in the delivery and outcomes of intensive care practice. Variation in practice and methodological limitations of existing studies were also noted, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to improving processes in the ICU. Conclusion: This integrative review has outlined potential for achieving practice improvements in intensive care and highlighted the need for further evaluative research to improve patient care at the bedside. &&copy; 2009 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.;Burrell, A.R., Elliott, D. & Hansen, M.M. 2009, 'ICT in the ICU: using Web 2.0 to enhance a community of practice for intensive care physicians.', Critical care and resuscitation: journal of the Australasian Academy of Critical Care Medicine, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 155-159.;Contemporary information and communicationstechnology (ICT), particularly applications termed \"Web2.0\", can facilitate practice development and knowledgemanagement for busy clinicians.

Comfort as a basic need in hospitalized patients in Iran: a hermeneutic phenomenology study. Aim. This paper is a report of a study conducted to explore the comfort experiences of hospitalized patients during their admission to medical-surgical wards in an Iranian hospital. Background. Comfort has various definitions, ranging from a basic human need, to a process, function or an outcome of nursing. As comfort is a substantive need throughout life in health and illness, providing comfort is a major function and challenge for holistic nursing care. Method. This hermeneutic phenomenological study was conducted between July 2006 and April 2007 in six medical-surgical wards of one of a university hospital in Iran. Data were generated with 22 participants (16 hospitalized patients and six nurses), using in-depth interviews to capture their detailed experiences of comfort. Analysis based on the framework of Diekelmann enabled data interpretation and elaboration of shared themes. Findings. One constitutive pattern, 'Comfort: a need of hospitalized patients' and four related themes - A friend in hospital, Relief of suffering within a calm environment, Seeking God, and Presence among family - were identified in the data. Conclusion. These findings offer unique insight for planning and implementing appropriate clinical practices in Iran, especially in caring for Muslim patients. Two major implications are to: (1) consider comfort criteria during nursing assessment and planning of care during a patient's hospitalization and (2) note that Shiite people in particular are more comfortable and feel better when they are able to follow their religious principles. &&copy; 2009 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Rolls, K., Kowal, D., Elliott, D. & Burrell, A.R. 2008, 'Building a statewide knowledge network for clinicians in intensive care units: Knowledge brokering and the NSW Intensive Care Coordination and Monitoring Unit (ICCMU)', Australian Critical Care, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 29-37.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Purpose: This paper describes the initial establishment of the Intensive Care Coordination and Monitoring Unit (ICCMU), and reports on the implementation of a state-based intensive care Listserv, ICUConnect, for staff in ICUs in New South Wales, Australia. The aim of the Listserv was to decrease professional isolation in smaller and less resourced ICUs by developing a network based on professional peer support. The Listserv was launched in December 2003 with 130 clinical nurse consultants and nurse managers. The emphasis was on exchange of both codified and experiential information. Material and methods: Evaluation of the Listserv was undertaken with a user survey piloted in 2004 and conducted in 2005. The survey explored the penetration, activity patterns and opinions of members of the Listserv. Members of the Listserv were mostly Australian intensive care clinicians and academics. Results: At the time of the survey, Listserv membership had grown to over 433 users. As expected rural members tended to ask questions of clinical support and advice, while nurse educators in metropolitan ICUs were the most active members on-list. The free exchange of information, especially in the form of policies and procedures, has led to the development of an information repository on the ICCMU website. Conclusions: The Listserv has created a beginning community of practice with ICCMU taking an active approach to knowledge management by facilitating exchange of information. The creation of ICCMU as a clinician-led resource has developed a structure that is ideally placed to act as a knowledge broker within a network of ICUs. A collaborative process to produce generic guidelines is now underway. &&copy; 2007 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.;Ladanyi, S. & Elliott, D. 2008, 'Traumatic brain injury: An integrated clinical case presentation and literature review.

Background: Postgraduate speciality education has proliferated within Australia over the past 20 years. However, there is little agreement regarding the expected characteristics, or relevant priorities, of these characteristics of graduates successfully completing these programmes of study. Method: This study used a mixed-method approach comprising two phases. Initially a survey was mailed to volunteers between March and June 2005 to obtain priorities in educational outcomes for graduates of critical care programmes. This was followed by a stakeholder focus group in May 2006 to refine expected outcomes. Results: Survey respondents rated educational outcomes that described professional and legal aspects of practice to ensure safe patient care as highest priority for programme graduates. Although most educational outcome statements were considered important for graduates from all levels of courses, increasing levels of practice was described for increasingly higher levels of programmes from Graduate Certificate to Masters Degree. Conclusion: This study provides an emerging description of the priorities of critical care nursing programmes, with priority given to professional and legal aspects of practice. Further delineation of priorities is necessary to inform ongoing educational development. &&copy; 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to describe women's experiences of recovering alone from acute coronary syndrome. Methods: Women attending cardiac rehabilitation were interviewed 3 to 9 months after acute coronary syndrome using a life history approach to address their personal/social background, professional life, and work-related processes, and to acquire an in-depth narrative of their recovery from illness in relation to this background. The sample included 11 women aged from 44 to 82 years who lived alone. Results: \"Being on my own\" was the pervasive theme, with independence being both required and valued. One subtheme included the complexity of social support arrangements women needed for their recovery. This was particularly important because women felt vulnerable when they were alone, particularly if they had experienced a sudden cardiac event or recurrent symptoms. Recurrent cardiac symptoms were an important subtheme because of the pervasive influence on women's lives, including their ability to work and plan ahead. Finally, the work and financial issues subtheme was a central concern for women, first because work was an important source of income and enjoyment, and second because loss of work meant loss of income. For some women, this meant selling their home or moving to another house. Conclusion: Women who live alone are an increasing proportion of patients with cardiac disease. Although they share many similar issues with other women and men who live alone, they seem to have unique concerns related to vulnerability, recurrent cardiac symptoms, social support, work, and finances.

Maintaining the currency of a local clinical practice manual is challenging however, particularly in relation to the time required, other workload pressures and the availability of staff with relevant skills to interrogate the literature. The aim of the Intensive Care Collaborative (ICC) project was to use the synergism of group processes to develop state-based clinical guidelines for six common intensive care practices - eye care, oral care, endotracheal tube management, suctioning, arterial line management, and central venous catheter (CVC) management. Methods: Participants were 55 senior nurse clinicians from all nine area health services in NSW, seven academic facilitators, and staff from the Intensive Care Coordination and Monitoring Unit (ICCMU). A range of approaches were used to develop the six clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and related systematic literature reviews, including a preparatory educational seminar for participants, formation of working groups of clinicians, with subsequent teleconferences, e-mail and online forums to identify the scope of each guideline and review the literature. A consensus development conference (CDC) was conducted to finalise the reviews with a nominal group technique (NGT) used to develop recommendations for practice. External Validation Panels (EVP) verified the recommendations in each clinical practice guideline. Group voting was undertaken using a Likert scale (1-3 disagree, 4-6 neutral, 7-9 agree) with consensus agreement set as a median of at least seven. Results: Eighty-three recommendations for practice were developed for the six Clinical Practice Guidelines, 50% were based on research literature evidence (23% with high levels of evidence).

To examine patients' memories and experiences of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a multiplace chamber of a hyperbaric medicine unit in Australia. Background. There is minimal literature available documenting patients' feelings and memories of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, particularly in a multiplace chamber. Design. Exploratory. Methods. A convenience sample of seven non-emergency patients was interviewed separately at the conclusion of their multi-session therapy. A semi-structured approach elicited in-depth information regarding their experiences and memories of the hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Interviews were 30-45 minutes long and audiotaped for transcription and analysis. Field notes were also used to note non-verbal cues and other observations not evident from the audio material. Data collection ceased when data saturation was evident from the interviews. Interview transcripts were examined using a content analysis approach, with textual coding and thematic development. Results. Issues derived from the data included: the uncertainty of the treatment, the noise and cold of the chamber, the discomfort of the mask or hood, and the boredom. Participant responses to the therapy related to previous noxious experiences and the individual's personality. Conclusions. This information was used to examine ways of reducing any negative feelings and experiences associated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, thus improving the service provided to patients. Relevance to clinical practice. Identification of these stressors and related issues may also enable subsequent development of a risk-stratification instrument to predict patients who do not complete treatment. &&copy; 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Marshall, A.P., Currey, J., Aitken, L.M. & Elliott, D. 2007, 'Key stakeholders' expectations of educational outcomes from Australian critical care nursing courses: A Delphi study', Australian Critical Care, vol. 20, no. 3, pp. 89-99.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: Educational preparation for critical care nursing in Australia varies considerably in terms of the level of qualification resulting in a lack of clarity for key stakeholders about student outcomes. Objectives: The study aim was to identify and reach consensus regarding the desired learning outcomes from Australian post-registration critical care education programs as demonstrated through the graduate's knowledge, skills and attitudes. Design: A Delphi technique was used to establish consensus between educators, managers, clinicians and students regarding learning outcomes expected of graduates with a Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma and Master level qualification in critical care nursing. Participants: A total of 164 critical care nurses (66 clinicians, 48 educators, 32 managers and 18 students) participated and 99 questionnaires were returned in the first round (response rate 60%). Fifty-seven questionnaires were returned for Round 2 (response rate 58%). Methods: Learning outcomes were obtained from the Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Competency Standards for Specialist Critical Care Nurses.

Previous studies were however, commonly from a quantitative perspective and often informed by the early work of Molter2 with the development of the 'Critical Care Family Needs Inventory'. Recent review articles identified the common needs noted from primary studies as: (1) to know about condition, progress and prognosis, (2) to feel hope, (3) to receive daily information in an understandable form, (4) to be contacted at home for any change in condition, and (5) to be reassured that staff care for the patient and are providing the best possible care.3 Limitations in the breadth and depth of the data produced with quantitative approaches were however highlighted. A smaller number of qualitative studies emphasised the need for relatives to protect the patient, and highlighted the important influences nursing staff have on relatives' experiences in having their needs met. The authors concluded that a continuing gap existed in the current literature, particularly in relation to individual and unique experiences of relatives which are best explored by inductive and interpretive methods.1. The resulting qualitative study used a grounded theory approach to explore the experiences of seven relatives of patients in two Danish ICUs. Participants were relatives of patients who were intubated and sedated and had been admitted to ICU for at least a week. Interviews for 1-2 h were conducted with the relatives in a quiet room in the hospital or their home, audio-taped and then transcribed.

Each year thousands of patients wait for organ donation note poor donation rates and importance of nurses in identifying potential donors. It is therefore important to identify knowledge levels and attitudes towards organ donation from brain dead patients of nursing students as future health workers. Using a 38-item instrument previously developed by the researchers, 292 undergraduate students in a Korean nursing college were surveyed in 2003 in Korea (response rate 92%). Validity and reliability of the instrument was demonstrated using a multiple analytical approach. A lack of knowledge regarding diagnostic tests and co-morbid factors of brain death were noted among students. Their attitudes toward organ donation were somewhat mixed and ambiguous, but overall they were positive and willing to be a potential donor in the future. While this study identified that an effective educational program is necessary for nursing students in Korea to improve their knowledge of brain death and organ donation, further research is also required to verify these single-site findings and improve the generalisability of results. &&copy; 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Aim: The present paper seeks to define and describe clinical leadership and identify the facilitators and barriers to clinical leadership. We also describe strategies to develop clinical leaders in Australia. Key drivers to the development of nursing leaders are strategies that recognize and value clinical expertise. These include models of care that highlight the importance of the nursing role, evidence-based practice and measurement of clinical outcomes, strategies to empower clinicians and mechanisms to ensure participation in clinical decision-making. Key issues: Significant barriers to clinical leadership are organizational structures that preclude nurses from clinical decision making, the national shortage of nurses, fiscal constraints, absence of well evaluated models of care and trends towards less skilled clinicians. Conclusions: Systematic, strategic initiatives are required to nurture and develop clinical leaders. These strategies need to be collegial collaborations between the academic and health care sectors in order to provide a united voice for advancing the nursing profession. &&copy; 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Aitken, L.M., Currey, J., Marshall, A. & Elliott, D. 2006, 'The diversity of critical care nursing education in Australian universities', Australian Critical Care, vol. 19, no. 2, pp. 46-52.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;A range of critical care nursing educational courses exist throughout Australia. These courses vary in level of award, integration of clinical and academic competence and desired educational outcomes, this variability potentially leads to confuson by stakeholders regarding educational and clinical outcomes. The study objective was to describe the range of critical care nursing courses in Australia. Following institutional ethics approval, all relevant higher education providers (n=18) were invited to complete a questionnaire about course structure, content and nomenclature. Information about desired professional and general graduate characteristics and clinical competency was also sought. A total of 89% of providers (n=16) responded to the questionnaire. There was little consistency in course structure in regard to the proportion of each programme devoted to core, speciality or generic subjects. In general, graduate certificate courses concentrated on core aspects of critical care, graduate diploma courses provided similar amounts of critical care core and speciality content, while master's level courses concentrated on generic nursing issues. The majority of courses had employment requirements, although only a small proportion specified the minimum level of critical care unit required for clinical experience. The competency standards developed by the Australian College of Critical Care Nurses (ACCCN) were used by 83% of providers, albeit in an adapted form, to assess competency. However, only 60% of programmes used personnel with a combined clinical and educational role to assess such competence. In conclusion, stakeholders should not assume consistency in educational and clinical outcomes from critical care nursing education programmes, despite similar nomenclature or level of programme. However, consistency in the framework for speciality nurse education has the potential to prove beneficial for all stakeholders. &&copy; 2006 Australian College of Critical Care Nurs...;Kim, J.R., Fisher, M. & Elliott, D. 2006, 'Knowledge levels of Korean intensive care nurses towards brain death and organ transplantation', Journal of Clinical Nursing, vol. 15, no. 5, pp. 574-580.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Aims and objectives. To develop and examine the reliability and validity of an instrument assessing knowledge levels of Korean intensive care unit nurses. To conduct a survey with Korean ICU nurses. Background. Organ donation from brain dead patients is a contentious issue in Korea following recent legal recognition of brain death, given the context of a Confucian belief system. Implementation of the new Organ Transplant Act has highlighted the importance of identifying Korean intensive care unit nurses' knowledge regarding brain death and organ donation. Design. Multi-stage multi-method development of an original instrument with a cross-sectional analysis survey of participants. Method. An 18-item instrument was developed based on previous literature and key informant interviews, and validated by an expert panel and a pilot study. A survey was conducted with Korean intensive care unit nurses (n = 520). Principal component analysis with varimax rotation was used to determine construct validity. Item-to-total correlations and Cronbach's coefficient alpha were used to determine the scale's internal consistency. Results. Principal component analysis yielded a two-component structure: Diagnostic testing and Co-morbid factors of brain death. The scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency for the two components (? = 0.74, 0.64, respectively). Most of the participants had a sound knowledge of diagnostic testing for brain death, but demonstrated a lack of knowledge regarding co-morbid factors of brain dead patients. Conclusions. The knowledge scale was reliable and valid for this cohort. Further research is warranted in related areas of nursing practice. Relevance to clinical practice. Effective education for intensive care unit nurses is necessary to increase the organ donor pool in Korea. &&copy; 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Elliott, D., McKinley, S., Alison, J.A., Aitken, L.M. & King, M.T. 2006, 'Study protocol: Home-based physical rehabilitation for survivors of a critical illness [ACTRN12605000166673]', Critical Care, vol. 10, no. 3.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Introduction: Numerous primary studies and several review papers have highlighted delayed physical and psychological recovery for survivors of critical illness, often beyond 6 months after discharge. This randomized controlled trial with blinded assessment aims to test the effects of an 8-week, home-based, individually tailored physical rehabilitation programme on physical and psychological recovery for survivors of a critical illness after discharge from hospital. Method: Participants are survivors of a critical illness discharged from nine intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia, who are aged 18 years or older, in an ICU longer than 48 hours, discharged home to self-care or carer (non-institutional care), able to participate in physical rehabilitation, and within the hospitals' local geographical areas for home visits. The study is based in participants' home environments. Blinded assessments at weeks 1, 8 and 26 after hospital discharge examine physical functioning, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life and psychological well being. The intervention is graded, individualized endurance and strength training prescribed by a pulmonary rehabilitation physiotherapist over an 8-week period, with three home visits, five follow-up phone calls, and a printed exercise manual supporting the training. Initial focus is on lower limb exercises and walking, with warm-up stretches, and progresses to the addition of core stabilization and upper limb exercises. Results: The burden of a critical illness is well documented. This novel study will determine whether a home-based physical rehabilitation programme improves the recovery trajectory for survivors of critical illness. The projected sample size of 200 patients aims to detect a clinically important 10% improvement in physical functioning. The study will also examine whether other important physical and psychological measures are improved.

This study investigated the impact of a specific intervention - the ICU liaison nurse role - in reducing ICU discharge delay using a prospective block intervention study. One hundred and eighty-six ICU patients (101 control and 85 liaison nurse intervention) with an ICU length of stay of three days or longer and who survived to ICU discharge were examined. The liaison nurse was involved in assessment of patients for transfer to the ward, with a major focus on coordinating patient transfer including liaison with ward staff prior to and following ICU discharge. Logistic regression was used to quantify the risk of discharge delay associated with the liaison nurse intervention with adjustment for potential confounding variables. While no demographic or clinical variables were significant predictors of ICU discharge delay, those in the liaison nurse group were almost three times less likely to experience a discharge delay of at least two hours and about 2.5 times less likely to experience a delay of four or more hours. The positive effect of the liaison nurse role in reducing the discharge delay remained after adjusting for potential confounders. We conclude that the liaison nurse role is effective in reducing the discharge delay in ICU transfer.;Elliott, D., Lazarus, R. & Leeder, S.R. 2006, 'Proxy respondents reliably assessed the quality of life of elective cardiac surgery patients', Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, vol. 59, no. 2, pp. 153-159.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background and Objective: The level of agreement between index and proxy respondents on assessment of health status of clinical cohorts is variable. There is limited information regarding agreement between cardiac surgery patients and their proxies, and levels of agreement examined across repeated measures. This study examined the level of agreement between index and proxy respondents' perceptions of the patient's health status prior to and following cardiac surgery. Methods: A prospective, paired-respondent, repeated measures observational study of elective cardiac surgical patients and their next of kin, from the cardiac surgical unit of a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. Health status domains were examined using the15D and SF-36 instruments at three points: prior to surgery, at hospital discharge, and at 6 months post discharge. Results: Moderate to good level of agreement was noted for physical function (physical functioning, role functioning-physical, mobility, breathing, speech, hearing, usual activities, sexual activities) and some psychosocial dimensions (role functioning-emotional, sleeping, depression, mental health). Agreement was highest for presurgery and 6 months post discharge. Differences in scores were not clinically important. Conclusion: Proxy respondents can reliably assess the quality of life of a cardiac surgical patient using 15D or SF-36, particularly for domains reflecting physical function. &&copy; 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Design: This was a prospective repeated-measures observational study. Setting: The study took place in a 650-bed tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. Methods: HRQOL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item health survey (SF-36) and the 15 Dimensions of Quality of Life questionnaire before surgery, at hospital discharge, and 6 months postdischarge. Results: Participants were representative of the cardiac surgery population. Scores for several concepts deteriorated at hospital discharge when compared with presurgery. There were significant improvements in health status at 6 months postdischarge when compared with previous measures for the majority of SF-36 and 15 Dimensions of Quality of Life questionnaire concepts, although mental health and social functioning demonstrated significant deterioration. SF-36 scores were substantially lower than population norms, but similar to previous studies of patients undergoing cardiac surgery except for mental health. Conclusion: Deterioration in health status at hospital discharge when compared with presurgery status reinforces the need for further patient care and support after discharge.

To develop and examine the reliability and validity of an instrument assessing knowledge levels of Korean intensive care unit nurses. To conduct a survey with Korean ICU nurses. Background. Organ donation from brain dead patients is a contentious issue in Korea following recent legal recognition of brain death, given the context of a Confucian belief system. Implementation of the new Organ Transplant Act has highlighted the importance of identifying Korean intensive care unit nurses' knowledge regarding brain death and organ donation. Design. Multi-stage multi-method development of an original instrument with a cross-sectional analysis survey of participants. Method. An 18-item instrument was developed based on previous literature and key informant interviews, and validated by an expert panel and a pilot study. A survey was conducted with Korean intensive care unit nurses (n = 520). Principal component analysis with varimax rotation was used to determine construct validity. Item-to-total correlations and Cronbach's coefficient alpha were used to determine the scale's internal consistency. Results. Principal component analysis yielded a two-component structure: Diagnostic testing and Co-morbid factors of brain death. The scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency for the two components (alpha = 0.74, 0.64, respectively). Most of the participants had a sound knowledge of diagnostic testing for brain death, but demonstrated a lack of knowledge regarding co-morbid factors of brain dead patients. Conclusions. The knowledge scale was reliable and valid for this cohort. Further research is warranted in related areas of nursing practice.;Kim, J.R., Fisher, M.J. & Elliott, D. 2006, 'Attitudes of intensive care nurses towards brain death and organ transplantation: Instrument development and testing', Journal of Advanced Nursing, vol. 53, no. 5, pp. 571-582.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Aims. This paper reports the development and testing of an instrument assessing attitudes of Korean intensive care unit nurses. Background. Reluctance by healthcare professionals to identify brain-dead patients as a potential donor is one reason for a shortfall in transplantable organs in all countries. Organ donation from brain-dead patients is a particularly contentious issue in Korea, following recent legal recognition of brain death within the cultural context of Confucian beliefs. Method. A 38-item instrument was developed from the literature and key informant interviews, and validated by an expert panel and a pilot study. A survey was conducted with Korean intensive care unit nurses (n = 520) from October 2003 to January 2004. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation was used to determine construct validity. Item-to-total correlations and Cronbach's coefficient alpha were used to determine the scale's internal consistency and unidimensionality. Results. The scale demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha = 088). Principal component analysis yielded a four-component structure: Discomfort, Enhancing quality of life, Willingness to be a donor and Rewarding experience. Overall, Korean intensive care unit nurses showed positive attitudes towards organ transplantation, despite some mixed feelings. Conclusion. The attitude scale was reliable and valid for this cohort. Areas were identified where professional development may enhance positive attitudes towards organ transplantation from brain-dead donors. Effective education for intensive care unit nurses is necessary to increase the organ donor pool in Korea. Further research could test the instrument with other populations. &&copy; 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Halcomb, E., Daly, J., Davidson, P., Elliott, D. & Griffiths, R. 2005, 'Life beyond severe traumatic injury: an integrative review of the literature', Australian Critical Care, vol. 18, no. 1, pp. 17-24.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;It is only recently that recognition of the serious and debilitating sequelae of trauma has prompted exploration of outcomes beyond survival, such as disability, health status and quality of life. This paper aims to review the literature describing outcomes following severe traumatic injury to provide clinicians with a greater understanding of the recovery trajectory following severe trauma and highlight the issues faced by those recovering from such injury. Electronic databases, published reference lists and the Internet were searched to identify relevant literature. The heterogeneous nature of published literature in this area prohibited a systematic approach to inclusion of papers in this review. Trauma survivors report significant sequelae that influence functional status, psychological wellbeing, quality of life and return to productivity following severe injury. Key themes that emerge from the review include: current trauma systems which provide inadequate support along the recovery trajectory, rehabilitation referral which is affected by geographical location and provider preferences, a long-term loss of productivity in both society and the workplace, a high incidence of psychological sequelae, a link between poor recovery and increased drug and alcohol consumption, and valued social support which can augment recovery. Future research to evaluate interventions which target the recovery needs of the severely injured patients is recommended. Particular emphasis is required to develop systematic, sustainable and cost-effective follow-up to augment the successes of existing acute trauma services in providing high quality acute resuscitation and definitive trauma management. &&copy; 2005 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.

While these studies have provided some insight into patients' physical function, social abilities and perceived quality of life, studies examining the experiences of individuals recovering from cardiac surgery have received only limited investigation. Aims: This paper presents a thematic analysis of interviews conducted with patients recovering from cardiothoracic surgery, about their memories and experiences of hospital and recovery post-hospital discharge. Methods: Using an exploratory qualitative approach, eight participants were interviewed 6 months following their surgery. Transcripts of interviews were examined using a content analysis approach, with open coding of text and categorising of similar concepts into themes. Findings: Participants reported varying degrees of pain and physical dysfunction during their recovery from surgery and some had still not returned to optimal function. Seven themes emerged from the data: impressions of ICU, comfort/discomfort, being sick/getting better, companionship/isolation, hope/hopelessness, acceptance/apprehension, and life changes. A number of the themes were constructed as a continuum, with participants often demonstrating a range of views or experiences. Many had little or no memory of their stay in the intensive care unit, although others had vivid recollections. Their impressions of hospital were mostly positive, although many experienced fear, apprehension, and mood disturbances at some time during their recovery. Most participants recalled being sick, reaching a turning point, and then getting better. Many participants reported a change in life view since their recovery from surgery.

This study was undertaken as part of a larger project examining the pain and health status of survivors of a critical illness. The aims of the qualitative aspect of the study were to examine the participants' memories of intensive care and hospitalisation at 6 months post-discharge, and to explore the impact of the critical illness experience on their recovery. Purposive sampling was used to enable rich descriptions of the experience of recovery from those patients best able to articulate their experiences. Three common themes were found with our six participants: Recollections, responses, and comfort/discomfort.

However, it is unknown whether there are associations between the experience of ICU and the incidence of chronic pain. A questionnaire - Pain Scale, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ), Centre of Epidemiology Study Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)- was sent to 99 consenting patients who had been in the ICU for 48 hours. Sixty-six and 52 questionnaires were returned at 1 and 6 months respectively. There was a general limitation in activities of daily living, younger ages (36-65 years) experienced a decease in work performance and other physical activities. Bodily pain increased, general health diminished, and engagements in social activities were severely affected. There was a decline in mental health for those 36-65 years of age. HR-QOL improved over time, 28% experienced chronic pain and had longer hospital length of stay (LOS), tended to have longer ICU LOS and were ventilated for longer. Those with chronic pain had significant reductions in physical function, bodily pain, general health and vitality. Ventilator hours and hospital LOS were associated with risk of chronic pain (OR 1.09, p=0.033 and OR 1.27, p=0.046). HR-QOL in ICU survivors declined, although there was a general improvement from 1-6 months. This decline in HR-QOL affected younger people (less than 65 years) more than older people.

The aim of this study was to explore sociocultural perspectives that influence health professionals' attitudes and perceptions regarding organ donation. Semistructured interviews were conducted with nine key informants from three major hospitals providing transplant services in South Korea. Several themes were identified as barriers to organ donation: Confucianism, misunderstandings and myths, organs as spare for selling, lack of clarity in the definition of death in the new legislation, and limited medical insurance coverage. It remains difficult for brain death to be accepted as true death, and there is currently a poor rate of organ procurement.

Australia supports a publicly funded universal health insurance system with a strong emphasis on primary care provided by general practitioners. The burden of chronic HF, and a social and political framework favoring community-based, noninstitutionalized care, represents an ideal environment in which home-based HF programs can be implemented successfully. Cardiovascular nurses are well positioned to champion and mentor implementation of evidence-based, patient-centered programs in Australian communities. This paper describes the facilitators and barriers to implementation of best practice models in the Australian context. These include the challenge of providing care in a diverse, multicultural society and the need for clinical governance structures to ensure equal access to the most effective models of care.;Davidson, P., Daly, J., Romanini, J. & Elliott, D. 2001, 'Quality use of medicines (QUM) in critical care: an imperative for best practice', Australian Critical Care, vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 122-126.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Quality use of medicines (QUM) as a discrete concept is gaining increasing importance in Australia and is supported by a policy platform which has federal government and health professional support. The QUM movement is also supported by a strong consumer base and this lobby group has been responsible for endorsement as a major health initiative. However, the importance of QUM to achievement of optimal patient outcomes has not achieved sufficient recognition in the critical care literature. Implicit in the discussion of QUM is the rational, ethical, safe and effective use of drugs within a best practice framework. Successful implementation of QUM requires appropriate infrastructure and the commitment and cooperation of medical, nursing and pharmacy staff. Support, education and training provide the prerequisites of knowledge, skills and awareness for quality use of medicines for all groups. An emphasis upon evidence based practice and the prevalence of polypharmacy in contemporary health care systems requires examination of factors that are barriers to best practice. QUM in critical care areas requires appropriately skilled staff who are competent to manage patients with a wide range of selected drugs, often in highly stressful situations. In many situations in critical care, the role of the critical care nurse is one of patient advocate. It is important to note that the delivery of critical care is not limited to a discrete setting and is inclusive of management at the trauma scene, assessment and delivery of care in the emergency department, through to intensive, coronary care and high dependency units. This paper presents a discussion of the concept of QUM and its relevance in the critical care context. Key theoretical, policy and research considerations for establishment of QUM in critical care are reviewed and discussed.

Quantitative data were collected with the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36, New York Heart Association classification, Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Scale, and the Jalowiec Coping Scale. A semistructured interview schedule provided additional qualitative data about the experiences of the survivors. * RESULTS The health status of participants was relatively stable during the 3-week period, most had no activity limitation due to dyspnea or angina. However, the subjects' health status was considerably lower than that of their age-matched population. The most common and most effective coping strategies adopted during this period were confrontation, optimism, and self-reliance. In addition, the subjects experienced anxiety, depression, ambiguity and uncertainty, fear of recurrence of the infarction and of deterioration in health, of boredom and of inertia. * CONCLUSION These findings can help nurses in hospital and community settings assist survivors of acute myocardial infarction to prepare for and deal effectively with experiences during convalescence.;Chaboyer, W. & Elliott, D. 2000, 'Health-related quality of life of ICU survivors: Review of the literature', Intensive and Critical Care Nursing, vol. 16, no. 2, pp. 88-97.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;The importance of health-related quality of life (HRQL) as a relevant outcome measure for patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management has only recently been recognized.

This paper contains a review of the theoretical basis for quality-of-life measures, discussion of some of the methodological issues, and examination of the findings from recent studies of the quality of life of ICU patients. Although not conclusive, the review identified that ICU survivors generally have poorer HRQL scores after a 6-12 month period of recovery than during their pre-admission period. This cohort also have lower HRQL than the age-adjusted general population. Despite this apparent poorer state of health, participants often claimed to be satisfied with their HRQL.

This paper describes an exploratory descriptive study that was informed by feminist principles, and which aimed to explore the recovery experiences of a group of women survivors of first-time MI in the initial period following discharge from hospital. A total of 10 female survivors were interviewed using an open-ended semi-structured interview schedule administered at 7, 14 and 21 days post-hospital discharge. Findings revealed that recovery was experienced as a complex process, initially characterized by fear and uncertainty. Over the duration of the study these feelings were replaced with a more positive outlook, a return of energy, and a sense of confidence in the future. Participants identified an unmet need for reliable information which persisted over the duration of the study. The findings of this study have implications for nursing practice and research. Chief among these is the issue of effective provision of information to women following an acute MI. The importance of providing relevant information to be understood and retained by people experiencing crisis cannot be overstated. Equally important are the provision of opportunities for patients to have regular contact with health professionals to question and seek clarifying information. These findings should now be tested on larger populations.;Elliott, D. 2000, 'Making research connections to improve clinical practice', Australian Critical Care, vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 2-3.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Underwood, M., Elliott, D., Aitken, L., Austen, D., Currey, J., Field, T., Grech, C., Kiegaldie, D., Pittard, M. & Worral-Carter, L. 1999, 'Position statement on postgraduate critical care nursing education - October 1999', Australian Critical Care, vol. 12, no. 4, pp. 160-164.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;The Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Limited (ACCCN) (formerly the Confederation of Australian Critical Care Nurses (CACCN)) considers appropriate preparation of specialist critical care nurses a vital component for the provision of quality care to patients and their families.

Traditionally, the measures have been mortality and morbidity, but they now also include assessment of indices such as functional status, health status, quality of life and patient satisfaction. This review paper examines 31 previously published primary studies that measured patient outcomes from adult general ICUs. Inclusion criteria for the review process included papers with explicit measurement of patient outcomes beyond mortality rates: functional status, health status and quality of life. The paper includes summative descriptions of the reviewed papers, discussion of the various methods, results and limitations, and some synthesis of the pooled findings. The review indicated that the health status and activities of the majority of survivors who responded to the follow-up measures were similar to what they were before their critical illness. However, whether these subjects are representative of ICU survivors in general is not conclusive, as lack of methodological control over exclusions and losses to follow-up were evident. In addition, the heterogeneity of the ICU population in terms of age, acuity and diagnoses complicates any potential comparisons. There is an opportunity for further studies in this area by nurse researchers, in either intra- or multidisciplinary teams.

The methods included combinations of per diem costs, hospital charges, direct consumption and unspecified cost estimates. Medical fees were commonly excluded and other costs, such as equipment and overheads, often not identified. Some more recent studies used clinical costing methods to capture individual patient-specific data, and demonstrated the feasibility and importance of these projects. Differing methods and data collection resulted in a limited comparative analysis, but issues requiring further research are highlighted.

Staff acceptance was identified as integral to the success of the system. A survey was issued to all nursing staff of the ICU to identify factors that affected attitude toward computers in the critical care environment. Factors resulting in negative attitudes then could be targeted through training and support for users. The factors considered that potentially could influence attitudes were age, nursing experience, intensive care nursing experience, and education. The study showed that nursing experience had a statistically significant effect on motivation to use computers.

The study unit had half the beds equipped with a CIS, and the remaining beds used paper documentation. Work sampling methodology was used to observe nurses working with both systems. Though there were differences for all activities between the environments and the directions of the differences were logical, none were statistically significant using a chi-square test (P =.11-0.65), probably because of the small sample size. This study established that work sampling methodology using a random timer is a valid and relatively easy method to capture work activity in the clinical area. Although this article does not provide definitive information regarding the benefits of a CIS over manual documentation, a number of important methodological issues are discussed, including the study design, procedure, use of dedicated observers, and the distinction between basic versus fully optioned systems. Future research should evaluate the efficiency, Impact on patient outcomes and nursing practice, and cost effectiveness of fully optioned systems. &&copy; 1997, Lippincott-Raven Publishers.;Elliott, D. & Hollins, B. 1995, 'Product Evaluation: Theoretical and Practical Considerations', Australian Critical Care, vol. 8, no. 2, pp. 14-19.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Products and equipment consume a substantial proportion of hospital or health service budgets. This is particularly the case in areas which use a high volume of consumables and technology, such as critical care. With cost containment strategies widely in force, the issue of using cost effective, quality products is becoming increasingly important. Hence, the evaluation of products should follow an objective and scientific process. This paper initially examines the theoretical basis of the cost/quality model, and compares product evaluation to the problem-solving and quantitative research processes. A flow diagram is then presented along with some practical considerations for achieving optimal quality and cost effectiveness in the evaluation of products. &&copy; 1995 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.;Elliott, D. 1994, 'The effects of music and muscle relaxation on patient anxiety in a coronary care unit', Heart and Lung: Journal of Critical Care, vol. 23, no. 1, pp. 27-35.;Objective: To test the efficacy of music and muscle relaxation techniques in reducing the anxiety of patients admitted to a coronary care unit with ischemic heart disease. Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Seven- bed coronary care unit of an Australian tertiary care hospital. Patients: Fifty-six patients admitted to a coronary care unit with unstable angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction. Outcome Measures: Psychologic (State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Linear Analogue Anxiety Scale) and physiologic (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate) variables were measured as indicators of anxiety. Intervention: Two or three 30-minute sessions of audiotape interventions were conducted with portable tape players with headphones. The two intervention tapes consisted of light classical music and verbal instructions for muscle relaxation. Results: With analysis of variance procedures, the null hypotheses were supported. No significant differences (p 0.05) between groups were demonstrated for the psychologic or physiologic variables, that is, no significant reductions in anxiety were achieved for patients using music or muscle relaxation interventions when compared with the control group. The effect size of the interventions on the outcome measures was 0.19 to 0.22, indicating a small effect. Resultant power was at a low level. Conclusions: These results differ from those of similar studies but may be related to the high probability of a type II error. Further investigation with longer intervention sessions and larger sample sizes is indicated. Similar studies should incorporate power analysis when reporting their results.;Potger, K.C. & Elliott, D. 1994, 'Reproducibility of central venous pressures in supine and lateral positions: A pilot evaluation of the phlebostatic axis in critically ill patients', Heart and Lung: Journal of Critical Care, vol. 23, no. 4, pp. 285-299.;Objective: To determine if the phlebostatic axis (PA) can be used to obtain reproducible central venous pressures (CVP) in laterally positioned critically ill patients. Design: A quasi-experimental study design was used. The outcome variable was central venous pressure. The explanatory variables were position (supine, 30 degrees right lateral, 30 degrees left lateral) and transducer leveling procedure (supine PA, upper PA, dependent PA). Each subject was used as his or her own control. Setting: General intensive care unit of a 929 bed metropolitan teaching hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Subjects: A convenience sample of 25 critically ill patients (15 men and 10 women) with an average age of 59.6 years &&plusmn; 15.2. Method: Each subject's baseline CVP range was collected over a 25-minute period in a supine position. CVP measurements were then obtained in the left and right lateral positions (initial lateral position alternated for each subsequent subject). When the subject was lateral, three CVP readings corresponding to the three transducer leveling procedures were taken. Data Analysis: One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (one for each leveling procedure) were performed. Clinical significance was deemed evident when the lateral CVP measurement exceeded the baseline range. Results: Statistically significant changes were associated with the upper PA (p 0.001) and the dependent PA (p 0.001). Only the supine PA yielded statistically nonsignificant changes in CVP (p = 0.073). However, power analysis indicated that the results were not conclusive (power = 0.520). Clinical significance was determined in 100% and 92% of subjects in the left lateral and right lateral positions, respectively, when using the upper PA whereas the dependent PA yielded clinical significance in all (100%) subjects. Clinical significance was seen in 46% and 42% of subjects for the left lateral and right lateral positions, respectively, when the supine PA was used.

The instruments were examined for correlation, reliability and internal consistency. Strong associations were demonstrated at pre-test between the STAI and the other scales. Moderate coefficients between HAD-A and HAD-D/LAAS were also apparent. Lower correlations were found at post-test than at pre-test. At post-test, strong inter-correlations occurred for STAI/LAAS. The HAD Scale demonstrated high test-retest reliability, while the STAI and LAAS were moderate in their reliability in this sample. The adequate correlation between the instruments suggest that each is a valid and appropriate measure of anxiety in this clinical sample. &&copy; 1993.;Elliott, D. 1992, 'Measuring patient anxiety in coronary care', Australian Critical Care, vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 12-16.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Patient anxiety is a common problem identified by nurses. However, the difficulty of assessing the level and significance of the anxiety is problematic. This paper discusses the issue of measuring patient anxiety, specifically in Coronary Care. As well as discussing physiological measures, three appropriate psychometric instruments are identified (the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAI, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - HAD, a Linear Analogue Anxiety Scale - LAAS), along with a review of the relevant literature.

The stress associated with an admission to a coronary care unit may be related to the severity and acuteness of the illness, the effects of hospitalisation on the individual, their family, their job and financial position, and often manifests itself as anxiety, fear or depression. This paper highlights the use of anxiety reduction strategies such as muscle relaxation, music, education and counseling. The literature reviewed does not provide any clear messages regarding the effectiveness of these strategies in the coronary care unit setting.

Whilst many legal theorists accept that the criminal legal system is a system of blaming, they do not consider that blaming involves censure or reproof for fault, wrong, badness or wickedness. Historically, the link between criminal law and morality was explicit, and expressed through evaluative terms in offence formulae such as malice and mens rea. Now, however, there is a tendency to think of crime in neutral procedural terms and to avoid reference to its normative elements. Through an analysis, which is both historical and contemporary, Penny Crofts reverses this modern tendency by addressing how the legal system communicates what it means to be at fault - to be bad, or to be wicked. Despite claims to the contrary, criminal law communicates and sanctions particular models of wickedness. Arguing that the current dominant idea of wickedness communicated in criminal law lacks nuance and fails to explain much of what the legal system does, Malice of Law examines its implications in terms of the legal subject, social responsibility and the jurisdiction of the legal system.;Crofts, P. 2011, Criminal Law Elements, Fourth, Lexis Nexis Butterworths, Sydney.;Criminal law text book.;Chapters;Prior, J. & Crofts, P. 2015, 'Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans-sexual: Commercial Sex' in Wright, J.

In this, it explores the contested relationship between community attitudes to sex premises, planning controls over such premises, and real world impacts arising from the application of these controls. The paper first looks at how the range of planning impacts from sex industry premises that were perceived in the past have framed the construction of present planning controls to regulate the sex industry in two Sydney local government areas (one inner and one middle). Survey perceptions of a sample of current residents and commercial firms located close to sex industry premises about possible impacts, as well as perceptions of sex premises in general, are described. The scope of impacts and perceptions measured draws on a range of research from legal studies, property and planning studies, and sociology. The findings are set against the operative planning controls and the assumptions and desired outcomes inherent in them in order to evaluate the appropriateness of the controls. The paper concludes with suggestions for amendments to controls that more closely reflect community perceptions of actual sex industry impacts rather than perceptions of assumed impacts, and reflections on the nature of the intersection of community attitudes to sex premises, planning controls, and the ensuing level and type of actual community impacts.;van Rijswijk, H.M. & Crofts, P. 2012, '\"Negotiating the Relationship between Law and Violence: the vampire as a figure of ambivalent justice\"', Socio-Legal Studies Association (UK), Socio-Legal Studies Association Conference 2011, Socio-Legal Studies Association (UK), Brighton, UK.;Publication of abstract for conference;Boydell, S., Crofts, P., Prior, J.H., Jakubowicz, A.H. & Searle, G.H. 2009, 'Sex in the city: regulations, rights and responsibilities in Sydney', State of Australian Cities (SOAC) Conference, State of Australian Cities Conference, Promaco Conventions Pty Ltd and DiskBank, Perth, Australia, pp. 1-24.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;The state regulates sex industry types in accordance with a range of complex, overlapping and often conflicting legal, policing, planning and administrative mechanisms.

Despite this, brothels continue to be treated differently from other commercial businesses with similar amenity impacts. The?planning principles? enunciated by the Land and Environment Court in Martyn v Hornsby Shire Council [2004] have been highly influential in the differential treatment of brothels. These planning principles are highly restrictive and go beyond traditional planning concerns. This paper argues that these principles are animated by an aesthetic of disgust. William Miller?s text Anatomy of Disgust, provides insight into why brothels may trigger disgust, due to their association with sex and immorality. The planning principles reflect disgust reactions, particularly in terms of the desire to remove the polluting and contaminating objects from the visual field. Finally, this paper considers strategies for reform in light of the association of brothels with disgust.;Journal articles;Prior, J. & Crofts, P. 2015, 'Is your house a brothel?

Policy debates on commercial sex services provide increasingly complex insights into work on the street and in large commercial sex premises, yet remain largely silent on the contribution of the domestic realm to commercial sex, despite estimates that it accounts for a significant proportion of all commercial sex transactions. Policies that affect home-based sex work are ambiguous and at times contradictory, veering from the promotion of working from home to anxieties about the assumed offensiveness of sex work. These policies have been often developed without direct consideration of home-based sex work and in the absence of evidence. Remedying this silence, this article analyses policy development for, and the experiences of, home-based sex workers in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The article concludes that working from home provides sex workers with opportunities for autonomy and wellbeing that are not available in other sex service environments, with minimal amenity impacts to the community.;Prior, J. & Crofts, P. 2015, 'Shooting Up Illicit Drugs with God and the State: The Legal-Spatial Constitution of Sydney's Medically Supervised Injecting Centre as a Sanctuary', Geographical Research.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 Institute of Australian Geographers. In 1999, the Uniting Church opened a Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) at the Wayside Chapel in the inner Sydney suburb of Kings Cross. The Uniting Church justified this overt act of civil disobedience against the State's prohibitionist model of drug usage by invoking the ancient right of sanctuary. This invocation sought to produce a specific sort of spatialisation wherein the meaning of the line constituting sanctuary effects a protected 'inside' governed by God's word - civitas dei - 'outside' the jurisdiction of state power in civitas terrena. Sanctuary claims a territory exempt from other jurisdictions. The modern assertion of sanctuary enacts in physical space the relationship between state and religious authorities and the integration and intersections of civitas terrena and civitas dei. This article draws upon conceptions of sanctuary at the intersection of the Catholic Christianity tradition and the State since medieval times to analyse the contemporary space of sanctuary in the MSIC, exploring the shifting and ambiguous boundaries in material, legislative, and symbolic spaces. We argue that even though the MSIC has now been incorporated into civitas terrena, it remains and enacts a space of sanctuary.;Crofts, P. 2015, 'The Identic Turn: The Culpability of Accessories and Perpetrators', Law in Context, vol. 33, no. 1, pp. 37-59.;The key question this article explores is why was Archer's culpability so difficult to judge.

However, the planning and licensing regulations excluding such premises from areas of residential land use are often predicated on assumptions of nuisance that have not been empirically substantiated. Accordingly, this paper reports on a survey of those living close to sex industry premises in New South Wales, Australia. The results suggest that although some residents have strong moral objections to sex premises, in general residents note few negative impacts on local amenity or quality of life, with distance from a premise being a poor predictor of residents' experiences of nuisance. These f ndings are considered in relation to the literatures on sexuality and space given regulation which ultimately appears to reproduce heteronormative moralities rather than respond to genuine environmental nuisances.;Crofts, P., Hubbard, P. & Prior, J. 2013, 'Policing, planning and sex: Governing bodies, spatially', Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology, vol. 46, no. 1, pp. 51-69.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Literatures on the regulation of conduct have tended to focus on the role of policing and the enforcement of criminal law. This paper instead emphasizes the importance of planning in shaping conduct, using the example of how planning shapes sexual conduct to demonstrate that planning can, in different times and places, exercise police-type powers. We illustrate this by analysing the regulation of brothels in Sydney and Parramatta, NSW, Australia, providing a case study of spaces of sexuality that historically were constructed and regulated as criminal, but have since become lawful. This paper examines the ways in which these transitions in law have been differently expressed and accomplished through local planning enforcement. In making such arguments, the paper emphasizes not only the potential for planners to act like police, but also the capacity of planning to supplant policing as a key technique of governmentality. &&copy;The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.;Hubbard, P. & Prior, J. 2013, 'Out of sight, out of mind?

In this paper, we explore this contention in relation to planning for sex service premises (brothels) in New South Wales, Australia. Though such sex service premises are now legal, our analysis nonetheless considers the way that these premises have been subject to forms of planning constraint that reflect planners' assumptions about the appropriate manifestation of sex premises within the urban landscape. By exposing the assumptions written into planning law that sex premises are legal but potentially disorderly, we demonstrate the evidential power of planning to reinforce dominant moral geographies through instruments which, at first glance, appear to be focused on objective questions of amenity and the 'best use of land'. This paper hence explores the ways in which planners have translated assumptions of disorder into categories of visibility and distance, meaning that brothels have become hidden in plain view so as not to disturb the integrity of residential 'family' spaces. &&copy;2013 Institute of Australian Geographers.;Crofts, P. 2013, 'The Poisoned Apple of Malice', Griffith Law Review, vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 150-179.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Contemporary criminal law tends to regard malice through the lens of act, intention and consequence. I argue that this modern reading of malice through contemporary patterns of blameworthiness is a misreading, and loses alternative (legal) ways of organising wickedness. Historical accounts of malice can and should be regarded as a (legal) resource by which to critique and enrich modern accounts of blameworthiness. To this end, I explore the construction of malice as a cogent, resonant concept of legal wickedness by treatise writers in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Treatise writers aimed to ensure that malice was sufficiently broad and malleable so that wickedness would not escape the law. Saunders' case was integral to the construction of malice, and it was used by treatise writers to claim and demonstrate the malleability of malice. Saunders had malice because he caused the death of a subject of the Queen, with premeditation and through the uncanny act of poisoning. The slippage across modern patterns of blameworthiness should not be regarded as a failure to settle upon a pure definition of malice, but as integral to the function of malice to persuade that wickedness would not escape the law.;Crofts, P. & Prior, J. 2012, 'Home Occupation or Brothel?

Underlying concerns about sex services premises generally are that they are criminogenic, disorderly and exploitative of women. This article draws upon original research of surveys of people living in the vicinity of sex services premises, interviews with sex workers and service providers, and council records of complaint to argue that, on the contrary, home occupations (sex services) can operate lawfully with minimal amenity impacts, and that this type of business can provide a positive work environment. We recommend that sex work in the home in New South Wales should be regulated in the same way as other home occupations. &&copy;2012 Copyright Editorial Board, Urban Policy and Research.;Crofts, P. 2012, 'Monstrous wickedness and the judgment of knight', Griffith Law Review, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 72-100.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2012, (publisher). All rights reserved. In February 2000, Katherine Mary Knight killed, then skinned, decapitated and cooked her lover in rural Australia. Knight pleaded guilty to murder and received a life sentence, against which she unsuccessfully appealed in Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292. I consider the way in which the majority judgments organised and expressed Knight?s culpability in accordance with a model of monstrous wickedness, arguing that models of wickedness articulated and applied in criminal law should be evaluated critically. The judgment of the court constructed and responded to Knight as bad, a monster who is (and will always be) dangerous (especially to men) and ultimately irredeemable. Not only do monsters justify and require extreme measures, they also contaminate and undermine systems of orders;8211# the judgments of Knight thus read more consistently with the genre of horror than that of law. The model of monstrous wickedness ostensibly works particularly well for women who kill, as it preserves the law?s tendency to organise women as lacking agency. However, this model also generates a clash of binaries when applied to women. The monster/victim binary ascribes agency to the monster, generating difficulties for the law to reconcile the notion of a female monster with legal assumptions of the absence of female agency. This results in the problem of the female monster. The judicial creation of a horror movie monster that lacks basic humanity facilitates an abdication of the legal (and moral) task of judging a human being as human.;Crofts, P. & van Rijswijk, H.M. 2012, '\"What Kept You So Long?\": Bullying's Gray Zone and The Vampire's Transgressive Justice in Let the Right One In', Law, Culture and the Humanities, vol. -, pp. 1-22.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;School bullying has been recognized only relatively recently by policy-makers, media and the courts as a serious and widespread social problem. But despite this recent notice, there has been no evidence that techniques adopted to stop bullying have led to anything more than modest success, implying that we need to do more work to unpack and theorize the nature of bullying. In this article, we consider a recent vampire narrative as a story about bullying. We offer an interpretation of this story via the theories of Claudia Card and Jacques Derrida, arguing that together this archive provides a more nuanced understanding of the kinds of damage inflicted by bullying than has been provided by realist or sociological accounts. In particular, it illuminates damage to the morality of the victim, to their soul, which is a kind of damage that has previously not been given great attention. It also highlights the ways in which practices of judgment can become very tangled when trying to resolve bullying situations, making these experiences resistant to the achievement of justice.;Crofts, P., Maher, J., Pickering, S. & Prior, J.H. 2012, 'Ambivalent Regulation: The Sexual Services Industries in NSW and Victoria - Sex Work as Work, or as Special Category?', Current Issues in Criminal Justice, vol. 23, no. 3, pp. 393-412.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Despite continuing contests in Australian states over the validity of sex work as work, Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) have been part of a global trend for states to decriminalise and/or legalise the sex industry. This article argues that although Victoria and NSW are united by their ambivalence toward the legal validity of sex work as work for women, this ambivalence is expressed and organised in different ways in each state, with consequent differences in regulatory schemas, practices of enforcement and outcomes for workers and communities. In particular, this article focuses on the regulation of sex services premises as a key indicator of how the sex industry is regarded and embedded within broader business, social and regulatory contexts. The article examines some specific regulations that affect women's status as sex workers in each state. It concludes by arguing that the failure to fully recognise sex work as work impacts most sharply on the safety and inclusion of workers: those whom the legislative schemas of both states purportedly seek to protect;Crofts, P. 2012, 'The proposed licensing of brothels in New South Wales', Local Government Law Journal, vol. 17, pp. 3-10.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;The New South Wales Coalition government is proposing to introduce a licensing system for brothels in accordance with pre-election commitments. This article argues that there is no evidence that brothels are criminogenic or inherently corrupting, nor any evidence that a Brothel Licensing Authority would effectively reduce and/or prevent crime and corruption. It considers the current New South Wales planning-based model and compares this with the Queensland and Victorian licensing models. There are other regulatory concerns associated with the sex industry, such as amenity impacts and health and safety concerns, it is argued here that these are regulated effectively under the current planning regime. A licensing authority is unlikely to improve the regulation of brothels in New South Wales in terms of illegality, amenity, and health and safety;Crofts, P. & Prior, J.H. 2012, 'Intersections of Planning and Morality in the Regulation and Regard of Brothels in New South Wales', Flinders Law Journal, vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 329-357.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;This article explores two questions through original primary research. First, can brothels be &&acirc;good neighbours&&acirc;in planning terms? That is, what kind of amenity impacts, if any, do sex services premises have upon the people living nearby? Second, do the different approaches adopted by two councils in New South Wales, Australia, matter in terms of amenity impacts, but also in attitudes to sex services premises? It is argued that brothels appear to generate minimal or neutral amenity impacts regardless of the regulatory approach adopted by council. However, the legal approach adopted by the different councils has contributed to the organisation and expression of the moral attitudes of local residents to sex services premises.;Prior, J. & Crofts, P. 2012, 'Effects of sex premises on neighbourhoods: Residents, local planning and the geographies of a controversial land use', New Zealand Geographer, vol. 68, no. 2, pp. 130-140.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The paper examines 284 resident submissions to sex premises planning processes, and a survey of 401 residents living near sex premises in New South Wales, Australia, to investigate resident concerns about the effect of sex premises on local environs, and how these concerns inform resident views on the spatial ordering of sex premises. The investigation found that there was a discrepancy between the views of the broader residential population and the views of participants in planning processes.

Recent research suggests that problem gambling provides a motivation for at least 15% of employee thefts in Nevv South vVa1es. Problem gamblers may steal from their places of employment either to finance their gambling or to repay gambling debts. The reasons why a person gambles excessively impact upon their offending pattems. Problem gamblers who believe that they will win, may initially 'bonow' money from work, in order to finance additional gambling to win back money they have lost. When they do not win, the continued irrational belief that they will win, provides the motivation to continue stealing in order to provide a big enough stake to win back the money they have lost and stolen. Additionally, if a person gambles to avoid stress or depression, and then steals from work to finance their gambling, this thieving can then become a major cause of stress in and of itself. This leads to sustained stealing from the workplace until the problem gambler is apprehended.;Crofts, P. 2003, 'Ambiguities in approaches to brothels: Disorderly Houses or commercial premises?', Environmental and Planning Law Journal, vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 445-458.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;In 1995, the Disorderly Houses Amendment Act 1995 (NSW) abolished the common law offence of keeping a brothel, making brothels a legitimate commercial land use regulated under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW).

In this chapter we examine recently passed legislation in Australia and Canada in the area of genetic modification technologies and reproductive genetics. We demonstrate that legislative control in this area has a twofold purpose. Less controversially it is aimed at providing limits to scientific innovation for the purpose of ensuring safe and ethical research and experimentation. More controversially it is concerned with what should be the proper \"nature of reproduction,\" namely) how it happens (sexually). between whom (a man and a woman. both human). in what kinds of relationships (heterosexual). such that progeny. the product of reproduction. inherit the blood/genes (bodily substances) of only two biological progenitors. It IS to this latter purpose that we turn our attention in this chapter, analyzing the role of law in limiting, determining, and constituting reproductive possibilities in an age of genetic modification. Our focus is on new and potential technologies that enable inheritable genetic modification (IGM) of humans. but we ~ead these, and their legislative limits, in the context in which they appear medically and legally. namely alongside other assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) such as reproductive cloning. We ask what is at stake in the new legislative limits. who benefits. who loses, and what kinds of humans are we left with?;Karpin, I.A. 2005, 'Genetics and the Legal Conception of Self' in Shildrick, M. & Mykitiuk, R. (eds), Ethics of the Body:Postconventional Challenges, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, pp. 195-216.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;The provocative contention of the postmodernist and feminist essays in Ethics of the Body is that conventional bioethics is out of touch, despite its growing profile. It is out of touch with an ongoing phenomenological sense of bodies themselves, with the impact of postmodernist theory as it problematizes the certainties of binary thinking, and with a postmodern culture in which bioscientific developments force us to question what is meant by the notion of the human self. The authors demonstrate that the conventional normative framework of bioethics is called into question by issues as wide ranging as genetic manipulation, disability, high-tech prosthetics, and intersexuality. The essays show how both the theory and practice of bioethics can benefit from postmodernism's characteristic fluidity and multiplicity, as well as from the insights of a reconceived feminist bioethics. They address issues in philosophy, law, bioscientific research, psychiatry, cultural studies, and feminism from a \"postconventional\" perspective that looks beyond the familiar ideas of the body, proposing not a bioethics about the body but a radical ethics of the body. After exploring notions of difference in both feminist and postmodernist terms, the book considers specific issues&&acirc;including HIV, addiction, borderline personality disorder, and cancer&&acirc;that challenge the principles of conventional bioethics. The focus then turns to questions raised by biotechnology: one essay rethinks the traditional feminist ethics of care in the context of new reproductive technology, while others tackle genetic and genomic issues. Finally, the book looks at embodiment and some specifically anomalous forms of being-in-the-body, including a consideration of intersex infants and children that draws on feminist, postructuralist, and queer theory.;Karpin, I.A. & O'Connell, K. 2005, 'Speaking into a Silence:The Australian Constitution and the Rights of Women' in Beverley Baines (ed), The Gender of Constitutional Jurisprudence, Cambridge University Press, New York, USA, pp. 22-47.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Karpin, I.A. 2002, 'She's Watching the Judges:media Feedback Loops and Judicial Notice' in Margaret Thornton (ed), Romancing the Tomes: Popular Culture, Law and Feminism, Cavendish Publishing, London, pp. 47-68.;Karpin, I.A. 1999, 'Peeking Through the Eyes of the Body: Regulating the Bodies of Women with Disabilities' in Jones, M. & Marks, L.A.B.

In exploring the process of decision-making about stored embryos, participants reflected upon their earlier experiences of clinic information-giving and counselling, particularly at the outset of treatment. The study found that the type and timing of the information given and the range of options presented by clinics in typical consent processes did not meet many participants needs. Informed consent processes in IVF involving the storage of embryos require a number of key changes. Consent to treatment and subsequent decisions about storage and further outcomes for stored embryos need to be addressed separately. To be effective, embryo directive forms should be accompanied by plain language explanations of their legal effects, including what elements are binding, the source of the rules governing decisions, and available formal and informal dispute resolution avenues. Consent and embryo directive forms should be made available on clinic websites to allow greater opportunity for reflection, as well as enabling patients to compare the options available at each clinic. Greater availability of ongoing counselling as well as other external sources of information are crucial to enable informed decision-making.;Millbank, J., Chandler, E., Karpin, I. & Stuhmcke, A. 2013, 'Embryo donation for reproductive use in Australia', Journal of Law and Medicine, vol. 20, no. 4.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;This article presents empirical findings on embryo donation for the reproductive use of others in Australia, drawn from a larger research project about the impact of law, ethical guidelines and clinical policies and practices upon the decisions that people make about stored embryos created during IVF. The authors interviewed 10 people who had actually donated embryos for the reproductive use of others and four people who were recipients of donated embryos. In addition, another nine interviewees had attempted to donate, or had a strong desire to donate, but had been prevented from doing so. The article places the present findings in the context of Australian and international research on widespread unwillingness to donate for reproductive use of others. The article then examines why the donors interviewed here were willing and able to donate, and presents findings concerning the donation process and models in operation, including matching and counselling practices and the contentious question of 'directed donation'. The article also reports the experiences of several 'would-be' or thwarted donors and examines the rationales for some of the external barriers to donation identified in the course of the study.;Karpin, I.A., Stuhmcke, A.G., Millbank, J. & Chandler, E.R. 2013, 'Analysing IVF Participant Understanding of, Involvement in, and Control over Embryo Storage and Destruction in Australia', Journal of Law and Medicine, vol. 20, no. 4, pp. 811-830.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;This article examines patient responses to the issues of embryo storage and destruction in IVF;Stuhmcke, A.G., Karpin, I.A., Chandler, E.R. & Millbank, J. 2013, 'Use of Stored Embryos in IVF Following Separation or Death of a Partner', Journal of Law and Medicine, vol. 20, no. 4, pp. 773-788.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;This article examines legal and policy restrictions on the use of stored IVF embryos after relationship separation and death.;Millbank, J., Karpin, I.A. & Stuhmcke, A.G. 2013, 'Towards facilitative regulation of assisted reproductive treatment in Australia', Journal of Law and Medicine, vol. 20, no. 4, pp. 701-711.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;This editorial introduces four articles reporting on the results of a four-year ARC-funded research project undertaken at the University of Technology Sydney. The study explored how Australian laws and policies across States and Territories affected the decisions of assisted reproductive treatment users with respect to their frozen embryos. In this editorial we offer some conclusions about the impact of the law which we argue fundamentally fails to take account of the diversity of ways in which embryos have meaning for the women and men who created them. We believe that informed choice and autonomy in the area of reproduction is vital. This goes beyond \"consent\" to a particular outcome and involves an active and ongoing process of selection. State intervention in decisions about family formation should only occur in pursuit of legitimate objectives, justified by evidence, and intrude only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. Therefore, we conclude that there must be a fundamental rethinking of the role of the state in the regulation of assisted reproductive treatment towards one of facilitative regulation. Major reforms that follow from this reconceptualisation include the provision of external information-giving and dispute resolution body or bodies to assist genuinely informed decision-making.;Karpin, I. 2012, 'The Legal and Relational Identity of the 'Not-Yet' Generation', Law, Innovation and Technology, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 122-143.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Ellison, D. & Karpin, I.A. 2011, 'Embryo Disposition and the New Death Scene', Cultural Studies Review, vol. 17, no. 1, pp. 81-100.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Ellison, D.A. & Karpin, I. 2011, 'Death without Life: Grievability and IVF', South Atlantic Quarterly, vol. 110, no. 4, pp. 795-811.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Bennett, B. & Karpin, I. 2008, 'Regulatory options for gender equity in health research', International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics, vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 80-99.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Karpin, I.A. & Bennett, B. 2008, 'Freedom to Choose?

However, there is no legal definition for this concept and its meaning varies among members of the community and the medical profession. Legal and policy responses to \"serious disability\" consist of an assortment of ethical guidelines, specific legislative frameworks and longstanding provisions of the criminal law, some of which were neither enacted nor developed with modern medical practices and dilemmas in mind. In addition, many of these regulatory frameworks and prohibitions vary between State and Territory jurisdictions. This leaves service providers, families wishing to utilise (or avoid utilising) diagnostic technologies and the broader community uncertain about the legal limits. This uncertainty has implications for women's autonomy in reproductive decision-making. For instance, services may be withheld, or their use encouraged, depending on differing understandings of the concept of \"serious disability\". The time has arrived for governments to consider whether it is appropriate to introduce a uniform set of guidelines and/or regulations across Australia for guiding clinical determinations of \"serious disability\".;Karpin, I. & Mykitiuk, R. 2008, 'GOING OUT ON A LIMB: PROSTHETICS, NORMALCY AND DISPUTING THE THERAPY/ENHANCEMENT DISTINCTION', Medical Law Review, vol. 16, no. 3, pp. 413-436.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Karpin, I.A. 2007, 'Choosing Disability: Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis and Negative Enhancement', Journal of Law and Medicine, vol. 15, no. 1, pp. 89-103.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Instances where preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is used to select an embryo for the presence of a particular disease or disability - the child would share characteristics with the parent - in Australia there appears to be consensus that PGD should only be used to select against serious disability - how we define disability - ethical issues surrounding \"negative enhancement\".;Karpin, I.A. 2006, 'The Uncanny Embryos: Legal Limits to the Human and reproduction without Women', Sydney Law Review, vol. 28, no. 4, pp. 599-623.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Law through both regulation and prohibition carries us forward in the imaginary leap that is necessary to take us from the embryonic being to the post-human being. Such beings include the hybrid, the chimera, the genetically enhanced, the inheritably genetically manipulated, the embryo with three genetic progenitors and the embryo produced by the fusion of same sex gametes. In this paper I explore how the law, by prohibiting the creation of certain kinds of embryos, is nevertheless giving legislative life to entities that are yet to be made. I consider how the law currently defines these entities and how it would define them if they were developed from the embryo to a fully birthed (human) being.;Karpin, I.A. 2006, 'Finding a place for altruism in Australian stem cell debates', Human Rights Defender, vol. 15, no. 3, pp. 17-19.;Karpin, I.A. & Bennett, B. 2006, 'Genetic Technologies and the Regulation of Reproductive Decision-Making in Australia', Journal of Law and Medicine, vol. 14, no. 1, pp. 127-134.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;This article provides a critical analysis of the current Australian regulatory landscape at the interface between genetics and reproductive decision-making. The authors argue that a comparative analysis with other countries and international law and a contextual examination of the way law regulates concepts such as disease and health, abnormality and normality is necessary before we can develop appropriate policy and legislative responses in this area. Specific genetic testing technologies are considered including prenatal genetic testing, preimplantation genetic diagnosis and inheritable genetic modification. An increasing number of members of the Australian community are using genetic testing technologies when they decide to have a baby. The authors argue that as concepts of disease and health vary among members of the community and the potential to test for traits other than illness increases, a new tension arises between an ethic of individual choice and a role for government in regulating reproductive decision-making.;Karpin, I.A. & O'Connell, K. 2002, 'Intimate Strangers: law, genetics, Globalisation and the 'Human Family'', Australian Feminist Law Journal, vol. 17, no.

It includes two articles with separate commentary by experts in other disciplines. The first article revisits earlier research (published in Sydney Law Review) examining amendments to the Prohibition of Human Cloning [for Reproduction] Act (2002) and the Research Involving Human Embryos Act (2002). The second article brings together two areas separately considered elsewhere, regulatory regimes around the use of PGD to choose an embryo with an abnormality and the use of body modification technologies for non-therapeutic or enhancing purposes. Research Contribution The first paper explores the legal regulation of biotechnologies that make it possible to create varying embryonic forms including clones and hybrids. It raises questions about the meaning of legal \"personhood\" and the role of women in the gestation of prohibited embryos. The second paper explores the role for law in regulating the use of genetic and cosmetic modification technologies where it is to achieve outcomes that do not conform to traditional ideals of normalcy. Research Significance This research interrogates the values we apply when regulating to limit or prohibit production of certain kinds of humans. The legal and ethical dilemmas posed by this regulatory task are novel and require a new degree of scrutiny that explores the underlying assumptions and motivations behind the law. This research begins an important international and cross-disciplinary discussion about the appropriate role for law in this context. The report appears both online and in CD form and has been distributed through the Canadian YIHR network.

This paper will discuss Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's welfare within a human rights framework, and begins with an analysis of what such a framework entails. It then will discuss three matters related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's contemporary human rights. Firstly, it discusses misconceptions about the relationship between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's welfare and rights which have gained some currency in Australia in the past weeks and months. Secondly, it examines the human rights framework recommended by Bringing Them Home for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's welfare. Finally, it evaluates reform to Australian child welfare legislation that has taken place over the past decade.

The research reviewed files from the date of initial contact with the Department up until 1999. The research was undertaken after the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families 1997 (NIATSIC) identified serious deficiencies in information about contemporary welfare removals of Indigenous children in Australia. Data presented to the National Inquiry demonstrated a disproportionately high rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in contact with child welfare services compared with other children. The disproportion increased with the severity of welfare intervention. As at 30 June 1997 the rate of Indigenous children on care and protection orders in NSW was 25.6 per thousand children which is over six times the rate for other children in NSW.[1] The rate of Indigenous children on care and protection orders in NSW as at 30 June 2001 was 37 per thousand children which is over nine times the rate for other children in NSW.[2] This would suggest that the over-representation of Indigenous children within the child protection system is not ameliorating.;Cunneen, C. & Libesman, T. 2000, 'Postcolonial trauma: The contemporary removal of indigenous children and young people from their families in Australia', AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES, vol. 35, no. 2, pp. 99-115.;Cunneen, C. & Libesman, T. 2000, 'An apology for expressing regret?', MEANJIN, vol. 59, no. 1, pp. 145-154.;Reports;Libesman, T.

Assessment and timely management of a deteriorating patient is a priority area for improvement highlighted by several Government, independent and health agency reports. Computer modelling of judgement processes can identify areas of difficulty in decision-making and assist nurses and other health care professionals to recognise and seek timely assistance for patients who deteriorate. Seminal work by Benner and Tanner on \"how expert nurses think\" led to the publication of Tanner's theoretical model of clinical judgement. This model maps the primary processes involved in clinical reasoning, and forms the basis of curricula in nursing courses internationally and within Australia. By explicitly modelling the time nurses take to progress through the processes of decision-making when planning and providing patient care, we can identify points where potential error and harm could occur, and thereby potentially improve patient outcomes.;Clay-Williams, R., Kelly, M.A., Everett, B., Perry, L. & McDonnell, G. 2011, 'Modelling clinical judgement improved health care delivery: using 'how nurses think' to manage the deteriorating patient', SimHealth, Sydney.;This papaer presents a dynamic model of reasoning, using computer based system dynamic processes based on a model of 'how nurses think' to support clinical decision-making in relation to detection and management of the deteriorating patient.;Gall, M., Lennon, S., Clarke, K., Cross, S., Cunningham, R., Edmans, J., Fitzpatrick, C., Hancock, N., Hoffman, A., Jones, A., Perry, L. & Walker, M. 2010, 'Intercollegiate Working Party for Stroke.

All rights reserved. Background: Optimising clinical responses to deteriorating patients is an international indicator of acute healthcare quality. Observation charts incorporating track and trigger systems are an initiative to improve early identification and response to clinical deterioration. A suite of track and trigger 'Observation and Response Charts' were designed in Australia and initially tested in simulated environments. This paper reports initial clinical user experiences and views following implementation of these charts in adult general medical-surgical wards. Methods: Across eight trial sites, 44 focus groups were conducted with 218 clinical ward staff, mostly nurses, who received training and had used the charts in routine clinical practice for the preceding 2-6 weeks. Transcripts of audio recordings were analysed for emergent themes using an inductive approach. Findings: In this exploration of initial user experiences, key emergent themes were: tensions between vital sign 'ranges versus precision' to support decision making, using a standardised 'generalist chart in a range of specialist practice' areas, issues of 'clinical credibility', 'professional autonomy' and 'influences of doctors' when communicating abnormal signs, and 'permission and autonomy' when escalating care according to the protocol. Across themes, participants presented a range of positive, negative or mixed views. Benefits were identified despite charts not always being used up to their optimal design function. Participants reported tensions between chart objectives and clinical practices, revealing mismatches between design characteristics and human staff experiences. Overall, an initial view of 'increased activity/uncertain benefit' was uncovered.

BACKGROUND: Effective working within a wide network of alliances is critical to patient outcomes. An understanding of collaboration amongst nursing leadership teams is essential within this context. METHODS: A sequential explanatory mixed-methods design was used. The Collaborative Behaviour scale was sent to 106 Nurse Unit Managers, Nurse Educators and Clinical Nurse Consultants to measure pairwise collaborative behaviours, two follow-up focus groups with 15 participants were conducted. Data were collected between May 2012 and May 2013. A thematic analysis of focus group data provided a detailed explanation of the questionnaire findings. RESULTS: The findings identified high collaboration between dyad groups. Two themes emerged from the thematic analysis: (1) professional role and expectations, with sub-themes of transparency and clarity of individual roles, and intra/interpersonal aspects of role functioning, and (2) organisational infrastructure and governance. CONCLUSION: These leadership teams can be effective and powerful vehicles for change and are central to optimum patient outcomes. Organisational strategic planning and evaluation can benefit from understanding how to promote collaborative behaviours in these nurse leaders. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: To date, little research has explored collaboration amongst nursing leadership teams. Successful collaboration may contribute to the efficient use of nursing resources, improve patient outcomes, and ultimately, nurse satisfaction and retention.;Pickler, R., Noyes, J., Perry, L., Roe, B., Watson, R. & Hayter, M. 2015, 'Authors and readers beware the dark side of Open Access.', J Adv Nurs, vol. 71, no. 10, pp. 2221-2223.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Appel, C., Perry, L. & Jones, F. 2015, 'Testing a protocol for a randomized controlled trial of therapeutic versus placebo shoulder strapping as an adjuvant intervention early after stroke', Occupational Therapy International, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 71-84.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. This study tested a protocol for a randomized controlled trial of therapeutic versus placebo shoulder strapping as an adjuvant intervention early after stroke. Despite widespread use, there is little evidence of the efficacy or acceptability of shoulder strapping to improve arm function in patients with shoulder paresis following stroke. This study tested a protocol designed to trial shoulder strapping as an adjuvant therapy in patients with shoulder paresis after stroke and tested its acceptability for patients and clinical staff. A multiple-method design comprised one quantitative randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and two qualitative exploratory investigations entailing patient interviews and staff surveys.

Background: Nursing is an emotionally demanding profession and deficiencies in nurses' mental wellbeing, characterised by low vitality and common mental disorders, have been linked to low productivity, absenteeism and presenteeism. Part of a larger study of nurses' health, the aim of this paper was to describe the mental health status and related characteristics of nurses working in two acute metropolitan teaching hospitals. Methods: A cross sectional survey design was used. Results: A total of 1215 surveys were distributed with a usable response rate of 382 (31.4%). Altogether 53 nurses (14%) reported a history of mental health disorders, of which n=49 (13%) listed diagnoses of anxiety and/or depression, 22 (6%) were currently taking psychoactive medication. Symptoms that could potentially indicate a mental health issue were more common, with 248 (65.1%) reporting they had experienced symptoms sometimes or often in the last 12month. Conclusion: Nurses and their managers should strive to create workplaces where working practices promote nurses' health and wellbeing, or at least are configured to minimise deleterious effects, where both nurses and their managers are aware of the potential for negative effects on the mental health of the workforce, where cultures are such that this can be discussed openly without fear of stigma or denigration.;Appel, C., Perry, L. & Jones, F. 2015, 'Testing a protocol for a randomized controlled trial of therapeutic versus placebo shoulder strapping as an adjuvant intervention early after stroke', Occupational Therapy International, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 71-84.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;This study tested a protocol for a randomized controlled trial of therapeutic versus placebo shoulder strapping as an adjuvant intervention early after stroke.

Background: Nurses make up the largest component of the health workforce and provide the majority of patient care. Most health education is delivered by nurses, who also serve as healthy living and behavioural role models. Anything that diminishes their health status can impact their credibility as role models, their availability and ability to deliver quality care, and is potentially disadvantageous for the health of the population. Study aims were to investigate nurses' overall health and the presence of chronic disease, to describe nurses' health-related behaviours and to compare them to those of the general population, with both groups matched by age and gender. Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive paper-based survey of nurses from two Sydney metropolitan hospitals using established instruments and questions and measurements taken with standardised methods. Results: This nursing sample (n = 381) had a mean age of 39.9 (SD 11.7, range 20-67) years, Most (n = 315, 82.7 %) were female, worked full-time (80.0 %), and were shift workers (93.0 %). The majority (94.0 %) indicated good, very good or excellent health, despite 42.8 % indicating they had chronic disease. The most common risk factors for chronic disease were inadequate vegetable (92.6 %) and fruit intake (80.1 %), overweight and obesity (44.0 %) and risky alcohol intake (34.7 %), health screening behaviours were not ideal. Aside from overweight and obesity, these risk factors were more prevalent in nurses than the equivalent group of the New South Wales population, particularly for risky alcohol intake which was much more common in female nurses and most marked in those aged under 35 years. However, 80 % met the guidelines for physical activity, more than the equivalent group of the New South Wales population. Conclusion: There are early 'warning signs' concerning the health status of nurses.

Background: Clinical deterioration of adult patients in acute medical-surgical wards continues to occur, despite a range of systems and processes designed to minimize this risk. In Australia, a standardized template for adult observation charts using human factors design principles and decision-support characteristics was developed to improve the detection of and response to abnormal vital signs. Objective: To describe the study protocol for the clinical testing of these observation and response charts (ORCs). Methods: We propose a two-phase multisite multiple-methods design to test the initial clinical utility of the charts in 10 hospitals of differing types and sizes across state jurisdictions in Australia. Data collection in the first phase includes user surveys, observations and field notes by project officers, handover de-briefs (short interviews with small groups of staff), and an audit of ORC documentation completion compared to the site's existing observation chart. For the second phase, data will be collected using a retrospective audit of observation documentation from the previous hospital observation chart, prospective audit of observation documentation following implementation of the selected ORC, user focus groups, observational field notes, and patient outcome data from routinely collected organizational data sources. Results: Site selection and preparation, project officer training, chart selection and implementation, participant recruitment, and data collection has been completed and the analysis of these results are in progress.

A quantitative epidemiological systematic review was conducted to identify the prevalence and predictive factors for development of retinopathy, nephropathy and hypertension in young adults (sample age mean [plus 1SD] 18-30 years) with type 1 diabetes, using processes adapted from established review methods set out by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus (Elsevier), CINAHL, Science Direct (Elsevier), Google Scholar and Cochrane databases were searched to identify relevant articles published between 1993 and June 2014. From this eleven papers were retrieved, appraised and results summarised by three reviewers using established methods. Results: Some form of retinopathy occurred in up to almost half of participants, more severe forms affected up to one in ten. One in six was reported with microalbuminuria, one in 14 had macroalbuminuria. Hypertension occurred in almost one in two participants. Applying out-dated high thresholds this decreased to approximately one in ten participants. Glycaemic control was a consistent predictor of vascular disease in this age group. Conclusion: Prevalence rates of retinopathy, nephropathy and hypertension in young adults with type 1 diabetes emphasise the importance of regular complication screening for early detection and treatment. The predictive effect of glycaemic control reinforces its importance for prevention of vascular complications. &&copy;2014 James et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;Appel, C., Perry, L. & Jones, F. 2014, 'Shoulder strapping for stroke-related upper limb dysfunction and shoulder impairments: Systematic review', NeuroRehabilitation, vol. 35, no. 2, pp. 191-204.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2014 -IOS Press and the authors. BACKGROUND: Shoulder impairments are common after stroke, resulting in reduced upper limb function. Shoulder strapping may be beneficial as an adjunct to conventional therapy and warrants further investigation. OBJECTIVES: To determine i) the efficacy and ii) any adverse effects of shoulder strapping used to reduce stroke-related upper limb and shoulder impairments and to improve function. METHODS: Three reviewers independently searched CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and PEDro databases and extracted data. Results were synthesized using descriptive methods and meta-analysis and interpreted in relation to potential risk of bias. RESULTS: Eight studies met inclusion criteria, recruiting 340 stroke participants. Studies predominantly included people with shoulder paralysis and examined shoulder strapping within four weeks of stroke onset for outcomes of increased upper limb function, reduced subluxation and pain. Strapping interventions, outcomes and measures were diverse, some studies encountered high risk of bias and findings were generally inconclusive with some indication of benefit in terms of delaying onset of shoulder pain. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence of efficacy or inefficacy with shoulder paralysis but shoulder strapping demonstrated minimal adverse effects and should be rigorously tested with shoulder paresis as well as paralysis after stroke.;James, S., Perry, L., Gallagher, R., Lowe, J., Dunbabin, J., McElduff, P., Acharya, S. & Steinbeck, K. 2014, 'Service usage and vascular complications in young adults with type 1 diabetes', BMC Endocrine Disorders, vol. 14.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Background: Few studies have examined young adults with type 1 diabetes use of health services and the development of vascular complications. As part of the Youth Outreach for Diabetes (YOuR-Diabetes) project, this study identified health service usage, the prevalence and factors predictive of development of vascular complications (hypertension, retinopathy and nephropathy) in a cohort of young adults (aged 16-30 years) with type 1 diabetes in Hunter New England and the Lower Mid-North Coast area of New South Wales, Australia. Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective documentation survey was undertaken of case notes of young adults with type 1 diabetes accessing Hunter New England Local Health District public health services in 2010 and 2011, identified through ambulatory care clinic records, hospital attendances and other clinical records. Details of service usage, complications screening and evidence of vascular complications were extracted. Independent predictors were modelled using linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: A cohort of 707 patients were reviewed, mean (SD) age was 23.0 (3.7) years, with mean diabetes duration of 10.2 (5.8, range 0.2 - 28.3) years, 42.4% lived/ 23.1% accessed services in non-metropolitan areas.Routine preventative service usage was low and unplanned contacts high, both deteriorated with increasing age. Low levels of complications screening were found. Where documented, hypertension, particularly, was common, affecting 48.4% across the study period. Diabetes duration was a strong predictor of vascular complications along with glycaemic control, hypertension was linked with renal dysfunction.Conclusion: Findings indicate a need to better understand young people's drivers and achievements when accessing services, and how services can be reconfigured or delivered differently to better meet their needs and achieve better outcomes.

However, the integration of theory, research and practice to develop community dietary educational programmes is a challenge that many interventionists feel ill equipped to achieve. Methods: In the present study, a community-based education programme was designed for Bangladeshi patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension. The goal of this programme was to reduce dietary salt intake in this population group, with a view to reducing their blood pressure and slowing kidney disease progression. Results: The present study sets out the first four steps of a six-step model for creating a behaviour change programme. Conclusions: These four steps were concerned with the translation of theory and evidence into intervention objectives, and illustrate how a practical, community-based intervention was developed from behavioural theory, relevant research, knowledge of practice and the target patient group. Steps 5 and 6, which are concerned with implementation and evaluation, will be reported separately. &&copy;2012 The Authors Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics &&copy;2012 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.;Lucas, B., Cox, C., Perry, L. & Bridges, J. 2013, 'Changing clinical team practices in preparation of patients for Total Knee Replacement: Using Social Cognitive Theory to examine outcomes of an action research study', International Journal of Orthopaedic and Trauma Nursing, vol. 17, no. 3, pp. 140-150.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Hayter, M., Noyes, J., Perry, L., Pickler, R., Roe, B. & Watson, R. 2013, 'Who writes, whose rights, and who's right?

Hand hygiene is a basic and essential but poorly conducted method to limit infection in hospitals. This practice development approach to implementing the '5 Moments for Hand Hygiene' national initiative aimed to increase compliance with the recommended hand hygiene practices, anticipating this outcome would be reflected in lower rates of healthcare-associated infections. Methods: Multiple methods were employed during October 2009-October 2010 within a multi-disciplinary initiative, although nurses were mainly recruited. Three medical wards, four surgical wards and the Intensive Care Unit were targeted. Project activities were informed by principles of practice development, solution-focussed coaching and models of behaviour change. Activities included active learning sessions, coaching, audit and feedback, competitions, creativity and fun. Outcomes were observations of hand hygiene compliance and routinely collected rates of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. Results: Overall hand hygiene audits showed statistically significant improvement in compliance, from 62 to 75% in quarterly audits. Compliance rates among nurses and medical staff increased significantly from 70 to 80% and from 43 to 63%, respectively, while changes for allied health practitioners, from 61 to 65% compliance, did not achieve significance. Recorded rates of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia reduced from between 0.6 and 2.55 infections per 10000 occupied bed days pre-project to between 0 and 0.65 infections per 10000 occupied bed days during the project period. Conclusions: Multiple methods using a practice development framework can be successful in effecting changes in hand hygiene behaviour among all health care workers.

Study aims were to identify the efficacy of lifestyle health promotion interventions intended to improve behavioural health risk factors and/or behavioural or clinical outcomes of working-age nurses. Background. Nurses constitute around half the health workforce but global shortages and an ageing profile challenge future supply. The occupational hazards and stresses of nursing are well known. Health promotion, possibly workplace-based, presents opportunities to safeguard the health of nurses. Design. This was a systematic review undertaken in line with guidance for reviews in health care. Methods. Seven electronic databases were searched from 2000-2011 and references of relevant papers. Two reviewers independently reviewed and critiqued retrieved papers and extracted data. Methodological features were described using the CONSORT checklists, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook classification. Results. With design inclusion criteria relaxed to include an uncontrolled trial, only three intervention studies were retrieved, from the United States, Canada and Taiwan. All had limitations and high risk of bias, but benefits were reported. Outcomes included fewer cigarettes smoked during the intervention period, down from mean (SD) 20 (8)-12 (9) per day (p0001), significantly reduced fat mass (068 vs. 007kg, p=0028), and significant gains across a battery of fitness assessments. The paucity of work focused on nurses' health behaviours was the important finding. Conclusion. The workplace is a potentially fruitful location for health promotion intervention but nurses have seldom been recognised as a target participant group. Given the international priority ascribed to nursing workforce retention, this is a missed opportunity for occupational health planning. Potential benefits to nurses' welfare and well-being may accrue from well-designed intervention studies. Relevance to clinical practice.

To describe the healthcare experiences of young adults with type 1 diabetes who access diabetes services in rural areas of New South Wales, Australia. Background. The incidence of type 1 diabetes in childhood and adolescence is increasing worldwide, internationally, difficulties are encountered in supporting young people during their transition from children to adulthood. Consumers' experiences and views will be essential to inform service redesign. Design. This was a qualitative exploratory study. Methods. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 26 people aged 18-28years living rurally, recruited through staff in four regional healthcare centres in 2008. Results. Two key themes were evident: lack of access (comprised of transfer to adult services, access to health professionals and access to up-to-date information) and age-appropriate provision. The impact of place of residence and personal motivation crossed all themes. Participants contrasted unfavourably the seamless care and support received from paediatric outreach services with the shortages in specialist and general practice-based care and information and practical problems of service fragmentation and lack of coordination experienced as adults. They identified a range of issues including need for ongoing education, age-appropriate services and support networks related to developing their ability to self-manage. They valued personal service, online and electronic support was seldom volunteered as an alternative. Conclusion. This was a first view of rural young people's experiences with adult diabetes services. Reported experiences were in line with previous reports from other settings in that they did not perceive services in this rural area of Australia as meeting their needs, suggestions for service redesign differed.

The present study aimed to describe nutritional status and food consumption in stroke patients within 2weeks of hospital admission and before discharge, as well as to investigate the effects of nutritional and dietary factors on rehabilitation outcomes. Methods: One hundred patients from a consecutive cohort admitted to a metropolitan hospital with acute stroke were recruited and assessed by a single researcher, with 38 reassessed at discharge. Nutritional status was assessed using Mini-Nutritional Assessment and anthropometric indices and dietary intake was assessed by 1-day weighed dietary records. Rehabilitation outcomes were changes in Barthel index scores and the rehabilitation efficiency index. Results: Few (n=9, 10%) consumed?100% of the estimated average requirement (EAR) for energy within 2weeks of admission and 13 (33%) had energy intakes 50% of EAR before discharge. A small but increasing proportion (7% at admission, 13% at discharge) were identified as being malnourished across the inpatient stay. Younger age, lower Barthel index and a higher energy intake in the early stages of admission predicted the extent and rate of restoration of functional abilities by discharge (F=7.503, P=0.001, F=14.558, P0.001). Conclusions: Given a general finding of nutritional deterioration identified for these patients, as well as the identification of energy intake as a modifiable influence on the extent and rate of recovery, there is clearly scope for the multidisciplinary development of nutritional support for stroke patients to improve rehabilitation outcomes. &&copy;2011 The Authors.

This study examined the relevance and fit of the PARiHS framework (Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services) as an explanatory model for practice change in residential aged care. Background. Translation of research knowledge into routine practice is a complex matter in health and social care environments. Examination of the environment may identify factors likely to support and hinder practice change, inform strategy development, predict and explain successful uptake of new ways of working. Frameworks to enable this have been described but none has been tested in residential aged care. Methods. This paper reports preliminary qualitative analyses from the Encouraging Best Practice in Residential Aged Care Nutrition and Hydration project conducted in New South Wales in 2007-2009. We examined congruence with the PARiHS framework of factors staff described as influential for practice change during 29 digitally recorded and transcribed staff interviews and meetings at three facilities. Findings. Unique features of the setting were flagged, with facilities simultaneously filling the roles of residents' home, staff's workplace and businesses. Participants discussed many of the same characteristics identified by the PARiHS framework, but in addition temporal dimensions of practice change were flagged. Conclusion. Overall factors described by staff as important for practice change in aged care settings showed good fit with those of the PARiHS framework. This framework can be recommended for use in this setting. Widespread adoption will enable cross-project and international synthesis of findings, a major step towards building a cumulative science of knowledge translation and practice change. &&copy;2011 The Authors.

Shoulder strapping has been reported as a beneficial adjunct to rehabilitation therapies but has not been rigorously trialled. This study tested the feasibility of recruitment, intervention and outcome assessment protocols for future trial of the clinical effectiveness of shoulder strapping.Design and setting: Feasibility study using a randomized controlled trial in an East London stroke service.Subjects: Fourteen acute stroke patients with mild to moderate upper limb hemiparesis were recruited between October 2004 and July 2005.Intervention: Five strapping methods and criteria for use were identified from the literature. Shoulder strapping applied for one month in addition to routine rehabilitation was compared to routine rehabilitation only.Main measures: The Motor Assessment Scale, Fugl Meyer Scale-Arm section and the Nine Hole Peg Test were measured at baseline and 1, 2, 3 and 5 weeks later. The Stroke-specific Quality of Life questionnaire was delivered at 6 and 12 weeks post stroke.Results: Useful findings were demonstrated in relation to the feasibility of all elements of the protocol. Motor Assessment Scale findings showed a small-moderate (0.27) effect size for the strapping intervention used as an adjunct to routine rehabilitation compared to routine rehabilitation alone. Sample size calculation indicated 312 participants would be adequate to test a null hypothesis of nil benefit additional to routine rehabilitation.Conclusion: Findings supported the value of pilot-testing, and enabled revision of the study protocol for future definitive trial. &&copy;2011 The Author(s).;de Brito-Ashurst, I., Perry, L., Sanders, T.A.B., Thomas, J.E., Yaqoob, M.M. & Dobbie, H. 2011, 'Barriers and facilitators of dietary sodium restriction amongst Bangladeshi chronic kidney disease patients', JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS, vol. 24, no. 1, pp. 86-95.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Perry, L. 2011, 'Editor's Choice', Journal of Advanced Nursing, vol. 67, no. 8, pp. 1645-1645.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L. 2011, 'Evidence-based nursing interventions warrant rigorous development methods', Journal of Advanced Nursing, vol. 67, no. 3, pp. 459-459.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Hodge, A., Perry, L., Daly, B., Tracey, D. & Hagness, C. 2011, 'Revision and evaluation of an emergency extended practice nursing role', Australasian Emergency Nursing Journal, vol. 14, pp. S3-S4.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L., Steinbeck, K.S., Dunbabin, J.S. & Lowe, J.M. 2010, 'Lost in transition?

Design, setting and subjects: Case note audit of 239 young adults aged 18-28 years with type 1 diabetes accessing five adult diabetes services before 30 June 2008 in three geographical regions of New South Wales: the capital (86), a city (79) and a regional area (74). Main outcome measures: Planned (routine monitoring) and unplanned (hospital admissions and emergency department attendance for hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia) service contacts, recorded measures of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure (BP). Results: Routine preventive service uptake during the first year of contact with adult services was significantly higher in the capital and city. Fewer regional area patients had records of complications assessment and measurements of HbA1c, BMI and BP across all audited years of contact (HbA1c: 73% v 94% city, 97% capital, P 0.001). Across all years, regional area patients had the highest proportion of HbA 1c values 8.0% (79% v 62% city, 56% capital) and lowest proportion 7% (4% v 7%, 22%) (both P 0.001). Fewer young people made unplanned use of acute services for diabetes crisis management in the capital (24% v 49% city, 50% regional area, P 0.001). In the regional area, routine review did not occur reliably even annually, with marked attrition of patients from adult services after the first year of contact. Conclusion: Inadequate routine specialist care, poor diabetes self-management and frequent use of acute services for crisis management, particularly in regional areas, suggest service redesign is needed to encourage young people's engagement.;Perry, L. 2010, 'Editor's Choice', Journal of Advanced Nursing, vol. 66, no. 9, pp. 1901-1901.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L. 2010, 'Editor's Choice', Journal of Advanced Nursing, vol. 66, no. 4, pp. 709-709.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L. 2009, 'Is BMI an accurate measure of nutritional status in older people.', Nurs Times, vol. 105, no. 37, p. 12.;Perry, L. 2009, 'Editor's Choice', Journal of Advanced Nursing, vol. 65, no. 5, pp. 921-921.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L. 2009, 'Editor's Choice', Journal of Advanced Nursing, vol. 65, no. 10, pp. 1991-1991.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L., Grange, A., Heyman, B. & Noble, P. 2008, 'Stakeholders' perceptions of a research capacity development project for nurses, midwives and allied health professionals.', J Nurs Manag, vol. 16, no. 3, pp. 315-326.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;AIMS: To evaluate stakeholders perceptions of the extent to which a research facilitator post was addressing aims of: * providing academic support to enable research involvement of nurses, midwives and allied health professionals, * supporting dissemination of research into practice, * contributing to research strategy development.

Many examples of good practice were identified, for example, nursing contributions to risk factor management and secondary prevention, service co-ordination and development, follow-up and support of stroke patients and their families. However, areas for further development include realigning services to a patient focus and ensuring equitable access, integrating services, supporting development of the nursing research evidence base and providing career and educational frameworks for nurses in stroke care. Nurses set out a vision for stroke nursing in which current strengths and developments are consolidated and disseminated in a dynamic, multiprofessional, integrated patient-focused service.;Perry, L. & McLaren, S. 2004, 'An exploration of nutrition and eating disabilities in relation to quality of life at 6 months post-stroke', Health and Social Care in the Community, vol. 12, no. 4, pp. 288-297.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L. & McLaren, S.M. 2004, 'Implementing Guidelines and Changing Nursing Practice: Intentions and Outcomes', Worldviews on Evidence-Based Nursing, vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 225-225.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L. 2004, 'Eating and dietary intake in communication-impaired stroke survivors: a cohort study from acute-stage hospital admission to 6 months post-stroke', Clinical Nutrition, vol. 23, no. 6, pp. 1333-1343.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L. & McLaren, S. 2003, 'Eating difficulties after stroke', Journal of Advanced Nursing, vol. 43, no. 4, pp. 360-369.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L. & McLaren, S. 2003, 'Coping and adaptation at six months after stroke: experiences with eating disabilities', International Journal of Nursing Studies, vol. 40, no. 2, pp. 185-195.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L., Morgan, J., Reid, F., Brunton, J., O'Brien, A., Luck, A. & Lacey, H. 2002, 'Screening for symptoms of eating disorders: Reliability of the SCOFF screening tool with written compared to oral delivery', International Journal of Eating Disorders, vol. 32, no. 4, pp. 466-472.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Perry, L. 2001, 'Screening swallowing function of patients with acute stroke.

Several reviews of range shifts of Australian coastal fishes (Booth et al 2011 and Madin et al. 2012) have highlighted approaches for collecting and applying the data. Research in Western Australia (e.g. Langlois et al 2010, Cheung et al. 2011) has shown that many species of groundfish and reef fish are distributed latitudinally based on clear water temperature gradients, suggesting that climate-change SST increases/differences will significantly affect ranges. Langlois et al. 2010 conclude that the old climatically buffered, oligotrophic seascape of southwestern Australia has provided a simple system in which the consistent influence of Temperate Fish 308 www.oceanclimatechange.org.au physiological gradients on the abundance and distribution of fish species can be observed\".;Booth, D.J. 2010, 'Natural History of Sydney's Marine Fishes: where south meets north' in Lunney, D., Hutchings, P.A. & Hochuli, D.

The workshop brought together 26 experts actively involved in the science and management of subtropical reefs. Its primary aim was to identify the areas of research that need to be most urgently addressed to improve the decision-making framework for managers of subtropical reefs. The main findings of the workshop were a sustainable subtropical reefs declaration that highlights seven research priorities for subtropical reefs. These are to (i) conduct research and management activities across local government, state and bioregion borders, (ii) understand natural variability of environmental conditions, (iii) quantify socio-economic factors and ecosystem services, (iv) benchmark cross-realm connectivity, (v) know marine population connectivity, (vi) habitat mapping and ecological research, and (v) determine refugia. These findings are hoped to form a basis for focussing research efforts, leveraging funds and assisting managers with allocation of resources. &&copy;2011 Ecological Society of Australia.;Booth, D.J. 2000, 'Larval supply, condition and persistence of the coral reef fish, Pomacentrus moluccensis.', Proceedings of the Ninth International Coral Reef Symposium, Indonesian Institute of Sciences and the International Society for Reef Studies, Bali, pp. 463-466.;Spatial and temporal patterns in population dynamics of reef fishes are thought to be largely driven by patterns of supply of larvae to reefs. Most attention to date has been given to patterns in density of incoming larvae, while the condition, or physiological health, of larvae has been largely ignored. In this study, I demonstrate that recruit condition is variable in time and space, and that condition affects patterns of post-settlement survival and thus population dynamics. Recruit condition (measured as lipid content per dry weight) varied from 2 to 25% across three locations on the Great Barrier Reef, and differed considerably among successive recruit cohorts at each site. A multiple regression model showed that recruit condition, larval supply/recruit density explained 26-99% of the variation in abundance of juveniles 6 months post settlement, and varied considerably among geographic locations and years. While the relationship between recruit condition and recruit persistence differed at these scales, it is clear that recruit condition may decouple any relationship between larval supply and recruitment of coral reef damselfishes.;Doherty, P., Kingsford, M., Booth, D. & Carleton, J. 1996, 'Habitat selection before settlement by Pomacentrus coelestis', Marine and Freshwater Research, pp. 391-399.;The neon damsel, Pomacentrus coelestis, is characteristic of surge zones on Australian coral reefs and is most abundant on outer slopes of reefs in the southern Great Barrier Reef. When settling, it appears to 'avoid' lagoonal habitats. Recruitment records confirm that this is a general pattern regardless of whether lagoons have permanent or temporary connections to the ocean. This study included direct sampling, around One Tree Reef from the southern Great Barrier Reef, of all presettlement stages of P. coelestis with the aid of light-traps, channel nets and a plankton purse seine. Pelagic juveniles were abundant in catches from light-traps moored outside of the reef crest. In contrast, this developmental stage was rare in catches from all gear types used within the lagoon. The channel nets collected newly hatched larvae that entered the lagoon at night, but either they did not remain in the lagoon or they did not survive because they were not taken from the lagoon by diurnal purse seines. This direct evidence shows that broad-scale habitat selection can begin in the planktonic stage. It implies that pelagic juveniles have excellent sensory and motor capabilities, which disqualify them from being classified and modelled as plankton. Temperature records from inside and outside of the lagoon indicated that warm plumes (up to 3&&deg;C above ambient) influence reef waters near One Tree Reef, and temperature may be one of the cues that presettlement fish use to identify lagoonal habitats.;Journal articles;O Connor, J.J., Lecchini, D., Beck, H.J., Cadiou, G., Lecellier, G., Booth, D.J. & Nakamura, Y. 2016, 'Sediment pollution impacts sensory ability and performance of settling coral-reef fish', Oecologia, vol. 180, no. 1, pp. 11-21.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Marine organisms are under threat globally from a suite of anthropogenic sources, but the current emphasis on global climate change has deflected the focus from local impacts. While the effect of increased sedimentation on the settlement of coral species is well studied, little is known about the impact on larval fish. Here, the effect of a laterite 'red soil' sediment pollutant on settlement behaviour and post-settlement performance of reef fish was tested. In aquarium tests that isolated sensory cues, we found significant olfaction-based avoidance behaviour and disruption of visual cue use in settlement-stage larval fish at 50&&nbsp;mg&&nbsp;L?1, a concentration regularly exceeded in situ during rain events. In situ light trap catches showed lower abundance and species richness in the presence of red soil, but were not significantly different due to high variance in the data. Prolonged exposure to red soil produced altered olfactory cue responses, whereby fish in red soil made a likely maladaptive choice for dead coral compared to controls where fish chose live coral. Other significant effects of prolonged exposure included decreased feeding rates and body condition. These effects on fish larvae reared over 5&&nbsp;days occurred in the presence of a minor drop in pH and may be due to the chemical influence of the sediment. Our results show that sediment pollution of coral reefs may have more complex effects on the ability of larval fish to successfully locate suitable habitat than previously thought, as well as impacting on their post-settlement performance and, ultimately, recruitment success.;Poulos, D.E., Gallen, C., Davis, T., Booth, D.J. & Harasti, D. 2016, 'Distribution and spatial modelling of a soft coral habitat in the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park: Implications for management', Marine and Freshwater Research, vol. 67, no. 2, pp. 256-265.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;CSIRO 2016. Habitat mapping is a useful method for understanding the complex spatial relationships that exist in the marine environment, and is used to evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies, particularly in regards to marine protected areas. This study explored the observed and predicted distribution of an uncommon soft coral species, Dendronephthya australis within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park. Dendronephthya australis was mapped by video operated by a SCUBA diver towing a time synchronised GPS. A species distribution model was created to explore the possible occurrence of D. australis outside of the mapped area, using four environmental parameters: bathymetry, slope of seabed, velocity of tidal currents, and distance from estuary mouth. Dendronephthya australis colonies occurred along the southern shoreline in the Port Stephens estuary between Fly Point and Corlette Point, but no colonies were found within sanctuary (no-take) zones within the marine park. The model illustrated limited habitat suitability for D. australis within a larger section of the estuary, suggesting this species has specific environmental requirements survival. Owing to its current threats (anchor damage and fishing line entanglement), implications from these findings will assist future management and protection decisions, particularly in regard to its protection within a marine park.;Thomson, A.C.G., York, P.H., Smith, T.M., Sherman, C.D.H., Booth, D.J., Keough, M.J., Ross, D.J. & Macreadie, P.I. 2015, 'Seagrass Viviparous Propagules as a Potential Long-Distance Dispersal Mechanism', Estuaries and Coasts, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 927-940.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2014, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation. Resilience of seagrass meadows relies on the ability of seagrass to successfully recolonise denuded areas or disperse to new areas. While seed germination and rhizome extension have been explored as modes of recovery and expansion, the contribution of seagrass viviparous propagules to meadow population dynamics has received little attention. Here, we investigated the potential of seagrass viviparous propagules to act as dispersal vectors. We performed a series of density surveys, and in situ and mesocosm-based experiments in Port Phillip Bay, VIC, Australia, using Zostera nigricaulis, a species known to produce viviparous propagules. Production of viviparous propagules was higher at sites with high wind and current exposure, compared to more sheltered environments. A number of propagules remained buoyant and healthy for more than 85&&nbsp;days, suggesting the capacity for relatively long-distance dispersal. Transplanted propagules were found to have improved survivorship within seagrass habitats compared to bare sediment over the short term (4&&nbsp;weeks), however, all propagules suffered longer-term (100&&nbsp;days) mortality in field experiments. Conditions outside of meadows, including sediment scouring, reduced the likelihood of successful colonisation in bare sediment. Furthermore, sediment characteristics within meadows, such as a smaller grain size and high organic content, positively influenced propagule establishment. This research provides preliminary evidence that propagules have the potential to act as an important long-distance dispersal vector, a process that has previously gone unrecognised. Even though successful establishment of propagules may be rare, viviparous propagules show great potential for seagrass populations given they are facing global decline.;Fowler, A.M., Macreadie, P.I. & Booth, D.J. 2015, 'Should we \"reef\" obsolete oil platforms?', Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 112, no. 2, p. E102.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Fowler, A.M., Macreadie, P.I., Bishop, D.P. & Booth, D.J. 2015, 'Using otolith microchemistry and shape to assess the habitat value of oil structures for reef fish', Marine Environmental Research, vol. 106, no. 1, pp. 103-113.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 Elsevier Ltd. Over 7500 oil and gas structures (e.g. oil platforms) are installed in offshore waters worldwide and many will require decommissioning within the next two decades. The decision to remove such structures or turn them into reefs (i.e. 'rigs-to-reefs') hinges on the habitat value they provide, yet this can rarely be determined because the residency of mobile species is difficult to establish. Here, we test a novel solution to this problem for reef fishes, the use of otolith (earstone) properties to identify oil structures of residence. We compare the otolith microchemistry and otolith shape of a site-attached coral reef fish (. Pseudanthias rubrizonatus) among four oil structures (depth 82-135m, separated by 9.7-84.2km) on Australia's North West Shelf to determine if populations developed distinct otolith properties during their residency. Microchemical signatures obtained from the otolith edge using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) differed among oil structures, driven by elements Sr, Ba and Mn, and to a lesser extent Mg and Fe. A combination of microchemical data from the otolith edge and elliptical Fourier (shape) descriptors allowed allocation of individuals to their 'home' structure with moderate accuracy (overall allocation accuracy: 63.3%, range: 45.5-78.1%), despite lower allocation accuracies for each otolith property in isolation (microchemistry: 47.5%, otolith shape: 45%). Site-specific microchemical signatures were also stable enough through time to distinguish populations during 3 separate time periods, suggesting that residence histories could be recreated by targeting previous growth zones in the otolith. Our results indicate that reef fish can develop unique otolith properties during their residency on oil structures which may be useful for assessing the habitat value of individual structures. The approach outlined here may also be useful for determining the residency of reef fish on artific...;Booth, D.J., Gribben, P. & Parkinson, K. 2015, 'Impact of cigarette butt leachate on tidepool snails', Marine Pollution Bulletin, vol. 95, no. 1, pp. 362-364.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 Elsevier Ltd. In urban areas, cigarette butts are the most common discarded refuse articles. In marine intertidal zones, they often fall into tidepools. We tested how common intertidal molluscs were affected by butt leachate in a laboratory experiment, where snails were exposed to various leachate concentrations. Mortality was very high, with all species showing 100% mortality at the full leachate concentration (5 butts per litre and 2. h soak time) after 8. days. However, Austrocochlea porcata showed higher mortality than the other 2 species at lower concentrations (10%, 25%) which may affect the relative abundance of the 3 snails under different concentrations of leachate pollution. Also, sublethal effects of leachate on snail activity were observed, with greater activity of Nerita atramentosa than the other 2 species at higher concentrations, suggesting it is more resilient than the other 2 species. While human health concerns predominate with respect to smoking, we show strong lethal and sublethal (via behavioural modifications) impacts of discarded butts on intertidal organisms, with even closely-related taxa responding differently.;Fowler, A.M., Macreadie, P.I. & Booth, D.J. 2015, 'Renewables-to-reefs: Participatory multicriteria decision analysis is required to optimize wind farm decommissioning', Marine Pollution Bulletin, vol. 98, no. 1-2, pp. 368-371.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Lajus, D., Yurtseva, A., Birch, G. & Booth, D.J. 2015, 'Fluctuating asymmetry as a pollution monitor: The Australian estuarine smooth toadfish Tetractenos glaber (Teleostei: Tetraodontidae)', Marine Pollution Bulletin, vol. 101, no. 2, pp. 758-767.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 Elsevier Ltd. The relationship between pollution level in estuarine sediment and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of resident smooth toadfish Tetractenos glaber was evaluated. A total of 188 fish from Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries (5 locations from each) were analysed for 28 bilateral skull bone characters. Sediment pollution was quantified based on analysis of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) and organochlorine pesticides (DDT, DDD, DDE, chlordane, dieldrin, lindane). Sediment toxicity was characterized using the mean quotient approach (MERMQ) and ranged from low to moderate level for heavy metals and from low to severe for organochlorides. The mean shape and directional asymmetry of fish bones differed among locations, suggesting a response to local environments. FA was positively correlated with organochlorine pesticides across locations, but not with heavy metals. These results suggest that fish FA could be a useful estimator of stress caused by organic toxicity based on the MERMQ approach.;Thomson, A.C.G., York, P.H., Smith, T.M., Sherman, C.D.H., Booth, D.J., Keough, M.J., Ross, D.J. & Macreadie, P.I. 2015, 'Response to 'Comment on 'Seagrass Viviparous Propagules as a Potential Long-Distance Dispersal Mechanism' by A.

Sydney Harbour is a global hotspot for marine and estuarine diversity. Despite its social, economic and biological value, the available knowledge has not previously been reviewed or synthesised. We systematically reviewed the published literature and consulted experts to establish our current understanding of the Harbour's natural systems, identify knowledge gaps, and compare Sydney Harbour to other major estuaries worldwide. Of the 110 studies in our review, 81 focussed on ecology or biology, six on the chemistry, 10 on geology and 11 on oceanography. Subtidal rocky reef habitats were the most studied, with a focus on habitat forming macroalgae. In total 586 fish species have been recorded from the Harbour, which is high relative to other major estuaries worldwide. There has been a lack of process studies, and an almost complete absence of substantial time series that constrains our capacity to identify trends, environmental thresholds or major drivers of biotic interactions. We also highlight a lack of knowledge on the ecological functioning of Sydney Harbour, including studies on microbial communities. A sound understanding of the complexity, connectivity and dynamics underlying ecosystem functioning will allow further advances in management for the Harbour and for similarly modified estuaries around the world.;Mayer-Pinto, M., Johnston, E.L., Hutchings, P.A., Marzinelli, E.M., Ahyong, S.T., Birch, G., Booth, D.J., Creese, R.G., Doblin, M.A., Figueira, W., Gribben, P.E., Pritchard, T., Roughan, M., Steinberg, P.D. & Hedge, L.H. 2015, 'Sydney Harbour: A review of anthropogenic impacts on the biodiversity and ecosystem function of one of the world's largest natural harbours', Marine and Freshwater Research, vol. 66, no. 12, pp. 1088-1105.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 CSIRO. Sydney Harbour is a hotspot for diversity. However, as with estuaries worldwide, its diversity and functioning faces increasing threats from urbanisation. This is the first synthesis of threats and impacts in Sydney Harbour. In total 200 studies were reviewed: 109 focussed on contamination, 58 on habitat modification, 11 addressed non-indigenous species (NIS) and eight investigated fisheries. Metal concentrations in sediments and seaweeds are among the highest recorded worldwide and organic contamination can also be high. Contamination is associated with increased abundances of opportunistic species, and changes in benthic community structure. The Harbour is also heavily invaded, but invaders' ecological and economic impacts are poorly quantified. Communities within Sydney Harbour are significantly affected by extensive physical modification, with artificial structures supporting more NIS and lower diversity than their natural equivalents. We know little about the effects of fishing on the Harbour's ecology, and although ocean warming along Sydney is among the fastest in the world, we know little about how the ecosystem will respond to warming. The interactive and cumulative effects of stressors on ecosystem functioning and services in the Harbour are largely unknown. Sustainable management of this iconic natural system requires that knowledge gaps are addressed and translated into coherent environmental plans.;Ollivier, Q.R., Bramwell, N.A., Hammill, E., Foster-Thorpe, C. & Booth, D.J. 2015, 'Are the effects of adjacent habitat type on seagrass gastropod communities being masked by previous focus on habitat dyads?', Australian Journal of Zoology, vol. 63, no. 5, pp. 357-363.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 CSIRO. Variation in abundance and diversity of organisms along habitat edges has long been a key research focus in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Previous investigations into edge effects in seagrass ecosystems have predominantly focussed on the seagrass-sandy substrate boundary. However, little is known about what role other habitats (e.g. rocky algal reefs) may play in faunal assemblage patterns. This study investigated the strength to which habitat type influenced gastropod assemblages within seagrass (Posidonia australis) beds, bordered by both sandy substrate and rocky algal reef. We found that benthic invertebrate community composition significantly changed with distance from rocky algal reef, but not with distance from sandy substrate. Proximity to rocky reef had a stronger effect on community composition than other local drivers examined (seagrass biomass and sand particle size). We hypothesise that gastropod affinity for rocky algal reef may be a result of both species-specific habitat preference, and lower predation pressure along adjacent rocky algal reef habitats. This study provides evidence that heterogeneous habitats within close proximity to seagrass beds may exert previously overlooked effects on the distribution of gastropod assemblages, highlighting the need for the inclusion of adjacent habitat type in experimental design for gastropod assemblage distribution studies.;Liggins, L., Booth, D.J., Figueira, W.F., Treml, E.A., Tonk, L., Ridgway, T., Harris, D.A. & Riginos, C. 2015, 'Latitude-wide genetic patterns reveal historical effects and contrasting patterns of turnover and nestedness at the range peripheries of a tropical marine fish', Ecography, vol. 38, no. 12, pp. 1212-1224.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 Nordic Society Oikos. Few studies have examined core-periphery genetic patterns in tropical marine taxa. The core-periphery hypothesis (CPH) predicts that core populations will have higher genetic diversity and lower genetic differentiation than peripheral populations as a consequence of greater population sizes and population connectivity in the core. However, the applicability of the CPH to many tropical marine taxa may be confounded by their complex population histories and/or high (asymmetric) population connectivity. In this study we investigated genetic patterns (based on mtDNA) across the latitudinal range of the neon damselfish Pomacentrus coelestis (36&&deg;N, Japan - 37&&deg;S, east Australia). We suggest a novel hypothetical framework for core-periphery genetic patterns and extend typical analyses to include genealogical analyses, partitioned?-diversity measures (total?SOR, turnover?SIM, and nestedness-resultant?SNE), and analyses of nestedness. We found that the existence of two divergent lineages of the neon damselfish led levels of genetic diversity to deviate from CPH expectations. When focusing on the widespread lineage (Pacific clade) nucleotide diversity was higher in the core, supporting the CPH. However, genetic patterns differed toward the northern and southern peripheries of the Pacific clade. The turnover of haplotypes (pairwise-?sim) increased over distance in the north, indicative of historical colonization with little contemporary migration. In contrast, although turnover was still dominant in the south (?SIM), there was no relationship to distance (pairwise-?sim), suggesting the influence of more contemporary processes. Moreover, the haplotype compositions of populations in the south were nested according to latitude, indicating immigration from lower latitudes toward the southern periphery. By extending the typical characterizations of core-periphery genetic patterns we were able to identify the effects of lineage sympatry on measures...;Feary, D.A., Pratchett, M.S., J Emslie, M., Fowler, A.M., Figueira, W.F., Luiz, O.J., Nakamura, Y. & Booth, D.J. 2014, 'Latitudinal shifts in coral reef fishes: Why some species do and others do not shift', Fish and Fisheries, vol. 15, no. 4, pp. 593-615.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Climate change is resulting in rapid poleward shifts in the geographical distribution of many tropical fish species, but it is equally apparent that some fishes are failing to exhibit expected shifts in their geographical distribution. There is still little understanding of the species-specific traits that may constrain or promote successful establishment of populations in temperate regions. We review the factors likely to affect population establishment, including larval supply, settlement and post-settlement processes. In addition, we conduct meta-analyses on existing and new data to examine relationships between species-specific traits and vagrancy. We show that tropical vagrant species are more likely to originate from high-latitude populations, while at the demographic level, tropical fish species with large body size, high swimming ability, large size at settlement and pelagic spawning behaviour are more likely to show successful settlement into temperate habitats. We also show that both habitat and food limitation at settlement and within juvenile stages may constrain tropical vagrant communities to those species with medium to low reliance on coral resources.;Booth, D.J. 2014, 'Do otolith increments allow correct inferences about age and growth of coral reef fishes?', Coral Reefs, vol. 33, no. 1, pp. 255-258.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Otolith increment structure is widely used to estimate age and growth of marine fishes. Here, I test the accuracy of the long-term otolith increment analysis of the lemon damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis to describe age and growth characteristics. I compare the number of putative annual otolith increments (as a proxy for actual age) and widths of these increments (as proxies for somatic growth) with actual tagged fish-length data, based on a 6-year dataset, the longest time course for a coral reef fish. Estimated age from otoliths corresponded closely with actual age in all cases, confirming annual increment formation. However, otolith increment widths were poor proxies for actual growth in length [linear regression r 2 = 0.44-0.90, n = 6 fish] and were clearly of limited value in estimating annual growth. Up to 60 % of the annual growth variation was missed using otolith increments, suggesting the long-term back calculations of otolith growth characteristics of reef fish populations should be interpreted with caution. &&copy;2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;Fowler, A.M., Macreadie, P.I., Jones, D.O.B. & Booth, D.J. 2014, 'A multi-criteria decision approach to decommissioning of offshore oil and gas infrastructure', Ocean and Coastal Management, vol. 87, pp. 20-29.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Thousands of the world's offshore oil and gas structures are approaching obsolescence and will require decommissioning within the next decade. Many nations have blanket regulations requiring obsolete structures to be removed, yet this option is unlikely to yield optimal environmental, societal and economic outcomes in all situations. We propose that nations adopt a flexible approach that allows decommissioning options to be selected from the full range of alternatives (including 'rigs-to-reefs' options) on a case-by-case basis. We outline a method of multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-criteria Approval, MA) for evaluating and comparing alternative decommissioning options across key selection criteria, including environmental, financial, socioeconomic, and health and safety considerations. The MA approach structures the decision problem, forces explicit consideration of trade-offs and directly involves stakeholder groups in the decision process. We identify major decommissioning options and provide a generic list of selection criteria for inclusion in the MA decision process. To deal with knowledge gaps concerning environmental impacts of decommissioning, we suggest that expert opinion feed into the MA approach until sufficient data become available. We conducted a limited trial of the MA decision approach to demonstrate its application to a complex and controversial decommissioning scenario, Platform Grace in southern California. The approach indicated, for this example, that the option 'leave in place intact' would likely provide best environmental outcomes in the event of future decommissioning. In summary, the MA approach will allow the environmental, social, and economic impacts of decommissioning decisions to be assessed simultaneously in a transparent manner. &&copy;2013 Elsevier Ltd.;Pradella, N., Fowler, A.M., Booth, D.J. & Macreadie, P.I. 2014, 'Fish assemblages associated with oil industry structures on the continental shelf of north-western Australia', Journal of Fish Biology, vol. 84, no. 1, pp. 247-255.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;This study provides the first assessment of fish associations with oil and gas structures located in deep water (85-175m) on Australia's north-west continental shelf, using rare oil industry video footage obtained from remotely operated vehicles.

While recent research has shown that developmental acclimation of metabolic attributes to ocean warming is possible, our understanding of the plasticity of key fitness-associated traits, such as reproductive performance, is lacking. We show that while the reproductive ability of a tropical reef fish is highly sensitive to increases in water temperature, reproductive capacity at +1.5&&deg;C above present-day was improved to match fish maintained at present-day temperatures when fish complete their development at the higher temperature. However, reproductive acclimation was not observed in fish reared at +3.0&&deg;C warmer than present-day, suggesting limitations to the acclimation possible within one generation. Surprisingly, the improvements seen in reproduction were not predicted by the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis. Specifically, pairs reared at +1.5&&deg;C, which showed the greatest capacity for reproductive acclimation, exhibited no acclimation of metabolic attributes. Conversely, pairs reared at +3.0&&deg;C, which exhibited acclimation in resting metabolic rate, demonstrated little capacity for reproductive acclimation.

Microchemical analysis of otolith (calcified 'ear stones' used for balance and orientation) of fishes is an important tool for studying their environmental history and management. However, the spatial resolution achieved is often too coarse to examine short-term events occurring in early life. Current methods rely on single points or transects across the otolith surface, which may provide a limited view of elemental distributions, a matter that has not previously been investigated. Imaging by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) permits microchemical analyses of short-term events in early life with high;60#10?m) resolution, two-dimensional (2D) visualization of elemental distributions. To demonstrate the potential of this method, we mapped the concentrations of Sr and Ba, two key trace elements, in a small number of juvenile otoliths of neon damselfish (Pomacentrus coelestis) using an 8?m beam diameter (laser fluence of 13.8&&plusmn;3.5Jcm-2). Quantification was performed using the established method by Longerich et al. (1996), which is applied to 2D imaging of a biological matrix here for the first time. Accuracy of 97% was achieved using a multi-point non matrix-matched calibration of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 610 and 612 (trace elements in glass) using Longerich's calculation method against the matrix-matched standard FEBS-1 (powdered red snapper [Lutjanus campechanus] otolith).

Climate-driven changes in biotic interactions can profoundly alter ecological communities, particularly when they impact foundation species. In marine systems, changes in herbivory and the consequent loss of dominant habitat forming species can result in dramatic community phase shifts, such as from coral to macroalgal dominance when tropical fish herbivory decreases, and from algal forests to 'barrens' when temperate urchin grazing increases. Here, we propose a novel phase-shift away from macroalgal dominance caused by tropical herbivores extending their range into temperate regions. We argue that this phase shift is facilitated by poleward-flowing boundary currents that are creating ocean warming hotspots around the globe, enabling the range expansion of tropical species and increasing their grazing rates in temperate areas. Overgrazing of temperate macroalgae by tropical herbivorous fishes has already occurred in Japan and the Mediterranean. Emerging evidence suggests similar phenomena are occurring in other temperate regions, with increasing occurrence of tropical fishes on temperate reefs.;Kelaher, B.P., Van Den Broek, J., York, P.H., Bishop, M.J. & Booth, D.J. 2013, 'Positive responses of a seagrass ecosystem to experimental nutrient enrichment', Marine Ecology Progress Series, vol. 487, pp. 15-25.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Nutrient enrichment of coastal waters is widely recognized as a major driver of seagrass decline. Under conditions where seagrasses are nutrient-limited, however, moderately elevated nutrient loads can enhance seagrass biomass and increase above- and below-ground consumers that support higher order predators. To improve understanding of bottom-up processes in seagrass ecosystems, we conducted a manipulative field experiment to simultaneously evaluate the responses of primary producers (seagrass and epiphytes) and the epiphyte- and the sedimentbased components of seagrass food webs to moderate and high levels of waterborne nutrients. Fifteen 7 m 2 sites in Zostera muelleri meadows were assigned randomly to control, moderate or high nutrient treatments and were enriched with 0, 1800 g and 3600 g respectively of slow-release fertilizer in above-ground dispensers. The experiment ran for 9 mo (August 2006 to April 2007) and the fertilizer was replaced every 2 mo to ensure continuous enrichment. The biomass of primary producers (seagrasses Z. muelleri, Halophila ovalis and associated epiphytes) and the abundance of predators in the epiphyte- and the sediment-based components of the food web were greater in nutrient-enriched treatments than in controls. Epiphyte grazers, deposit feeders/detritivores, suspension feeders and benthic grazers did not respond significantly to the nutrient enrichment. In general, responses to nutrient enrichment were similar for medium and high nutrient treatments except that the biomass and surface area of seagrass was greater in high enrichment sites. These results demonstrate that Z. muelleri-dominated seagrass meadows in oligotrophic systems may be resilient to greater nutrient loads. Effective conservation strategies for Z. muelleri meadows should continue to consider interactions among nutrient enrichment and other key anthropogenic stressors, particularly non-nutrient pollutants in runoff and sewage discharge. &&copy;Inter-Research 2013.;Poulos, D.E., Harasti, D., Gallen, C. & Booth, D.J. 2013, 'Biodiversity value of a geographically restricted soft coral species within a temperate estuary', Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems, vol. 23, no. 6, pp. 838-849.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;A threatened and uncommon soft coral species, Dendronephthya australis found in large abundance in Port Stephens, within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park (PSGLMP), New South Wales, Australia, was hypothesized to be an important habitat for many marine fishes and invertebrates, but is currently under threat from boat anchors, fishing debris entanglement and sand inundation. Surveys were undertaken to assess the biodiversity associated with the soft coral habitat and its adjacent habitats (sponge, seagrass and unvegetated sand), using a combination of Underwater Visual Census (UVC) and Baited Remote Underwater Video System (BRUVS) techniques. In total, 77 fish species and 21 invertebrate species utilized the D. australis habitat, and multivariate fish assemblages associated with soft corals were significantly different to those associated with nearby sponges, seagrass and sand habitats. Species richness of fishes and invertebrates were significantly higher in soft coral and sponge habitats than seagrass. The D. australis habitat was found to be of high importance to juvenile snapper (Pagrus auratus: Sparidae), a species of recreational and commercial fishery importance, which occurred in highest abundance within D. australis, and were significantly smaller in size within the soft coral habitat than the adjacent sponge habitat. Evidently, this rare soft coral habitat supports an extensive marine assemblage, potentially providing a valuable source of food and shelter for fishes and invertebrates, and given it is threatened by human-induced impacts, its protection should be a priority. &&copy;2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;York, P.H., Gruber, R.K., Hill, R., Ralph, P.J., Booth, D.J. & Macreadie, P.I. 2013, 'Physiological and Morphological Responses of the Temperate Seagrass Zostera muelleri to Multiple Stressors: Investigating the Interactive Effects of Light and Temperature', PLoS ONE, vol. 8, no. 10.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Understanding how multiple environmental stressors interact to affect seagrass health (measured as morphological and physiological responses) is important for responding to global declines in seagrass populations.

Z. muelleri is widely distributed throughout the temperate and tropical waters of south and east coasts of Australia, and is regarded as a regionally significant species. Optimal growth was observed at 27&&deg;C, whereas rapid loss of living shoots and leaf mass occurred at 32&&deg;C. We found no difference in the concentration of photosynthetic pigments among temperature treatments by the end of the experiment, however, up-regulation of photoprotective pigments was observed at 30&&deg;C. Greater levels of shade resulting in high photochemical efficiencies, while elevated irradiance suppressed effective quantum yield (?F/FM'). Chlorophyll fluorescence fast induction curves (FIC) revealed that the J step amplitude was significantly higher in the 0% shade treatment after 8 weeks, indicating a closure of PSII reaction centres, which likely contributed to the decline in?F/FM' and photoinhibition under higher irradiance. Effective quantum yield of PSII (?F/FM') declined steadily in 32&&deg;C treatments, indicating thermal damage. Higher temperatures (30&&deg;C) resulted in reduced above-ground biomass ratio and smaller leaves, while reduced light led to a reduction in leaf and shoot density, above-ground biomass ratio, shoot biomass and an increase in leaf senescence.

However, effects of ARs on marine communities remain unknown, because it is unclear whether ARs can maintain similar communities to natural reefs. We investigated whether well-established (30 years old) breakwaters could consistently approximate fish assemblages on interspersed rocky reefs in a temperate estuary over 6 consecutive seasons using regular visual surveys between June 2009 (winter) and November 2010 (spring). We examined whether assemblage differences between reef types were driven by differences in juvenile recruitment, or were related to differences in older life-stages. Assemblages on both reef types were dominated by juveniles (61% of individuals) and sub-adults (34% of individuals). Seasonal fluctuations in assemblage parameters (species richness, diversity, sub-adult abundance) were similar between reef types, and levels of species diversity and assemblage composition were generally comparable. However, abundance and species richness were consistently higher (1.9-7.6 and 1.3-2.6 times, respectively) on breakwaters. These assemblage differences could not be explained by differences in juvenile recruitment, with seasonal patterns of recruitment and juvenile species found to be similar between reef types. In contrast, abundances of sub-adults were consistently higher (1.1-12 times) at breakwaters, and assemblage differences appeared to be driven by this life-stage. Our results indicate that breakwaters in temperate estuaries are capable of supporting abundant and diverse fish assemblages with similar recruitment process to natural reefs. However, breakwaters may not approximate all aspects of natural assemblage structure, with differences maintained by a single-life stage in some cases. &&copy;2013 Fowler, Booth et al.;York, P.H., Kelaher, B.P., Booth, D.J. & Bishop, M.J. 2012, 'Trophic responses to nutrient enrichment in a temperate seagrass food chain', Marine Ecology Progress Series, vol. 449, pp. 291-296.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Simple ecological models that predict trophic responses to bottom-up forcing are valuable tools for ecosystem managers. Traditionally, theoretical ecologists have used resource-dependent functional responses to explain the modification of food chains exposed to bottom-up perturbations. These models predict alternating positive, negative and zero responses at each trophic level. More recently, ratio-dependent functional response models that predict proportional increases at each level have challenged this paradigm. The present study tested the predictions of the 2 hypotheses empirically by comparing the relative biomasses of 4 trophic levels of an estuarine seagrass food chain in relatively undisturbed, low-nutrient catchments and 'developed' catchments subjected to a prolonged period of nutrient enrichment. We found that nutrient-enriched sites had significantly greater biomass of both epiphytic algae and grazing invertebrates, however, the bottom- up forcing of nutrients was attenuated at higher trophic levels (occupied by juvenile and piscivorous fish), with no significant effect of catchment development. This disconnect in the upward cascade of energy may be due to a number of possible reasons including high levels of diversity and omnivory, trophic subsidy within the system or the strength or nature of perturbations. Although the predictions of both hypotheses failed to hold across all trophic groups, ratio dependence was prevalent at the lower levels of the food chain, which has implications for catchment management. &&copy;2012 Inter-Research.;Parkinson, K.L., Booth, D.J. & Lee, J.E. 2012, 'Validation of otolith daily increment formation for two temperate syngnathid fishes: The pipefishes Stigmatopora argus and Stigmatopora nigra', Journal of Fish Biology, vol. 80, no. 3, pp. 698-704.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Otoliths were used for the first time to successfully validate the age of members of the family Syngnathidae: the spotted pipefish Stigmatopora argus and the wide-bodied pipefish Stigmatopora nigra.

All life-history stages, including recently settled juveniles, females and terminal males, of P. rubrizonatus were caught, ranging in standard length (L s) from 169 to 965 mm.

Fish abundance, species richness, diversity and feeding guild structure on wrecks were similar to natural reefs, however, species composition differed between the two reef types (R = 0.189-0.341, average dissimilarity: 67.3-68.8 %). Despite being more species-rich and diverse, fish assemblages on larger wrecks were less similar to assemblages on their adjacent natural reefs than smaller wrecks. Wrecks may also have affected fish abundance on adjacent natural reefs, with reefs adjacent to larger wrecks supporting higher abundances than reefs adjacent to smaller wrecks. Our results indicate that increases in vessel-reef habitat may not greatly affect reef fish assemblage parameters, but may affect the relative abundances of particular species. &&copy;2012 Springer-Verlag.;Booth, D.J. 2012, 'Science under siege-comment on Kearney article: Faith, vested interests and the scientific method: A critique of Kearney', Australian Zoologist, vol. 36, no. 2, pp. 143-144.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Sanchez-Camara, J., Martin-Smith, K., Booth, D.J., Fritschi, J. & Turon, X. 2011, 'Demographics and vulnerability of a unique Australian fish, the weedy seadragon Phyllopteryx taeniolatus', Marine Ecology Progress Series, vol. 422, pp. 253-264.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The weedy seadragon Phyllopteryx taeniolatus is a vulnerable and endemic Australian fish and also an icon and flagship species for marine conservation.

Population densities varied from ca. 10 to 70 seadragons ha-1 depending on site and year. There was a significant decline in the number of weedy seadragon sightings per unit area searched in 2 out of 3 study sites near Sydney, NSW, from 2001 to 2007. There was also a decline at one of the 2 sites surveyed in the lower Derwent Estuary, TAS, in 2009 compared to 2003 and 2004. Survival rates at NSW sites ranged from 0.62 to 0.65 yr-1 and were higher at TAS sites where they ranged from 0.71 to 0.77 yr-1.

For C. auriga, apart from significantly longer PLDs at Lord Howe Island and Jervis Bay (means of 54 and 52 days, respectively), all locations had similar PLDs (mean 41 days). For C. flavirostris, there was no significant location effect on PLD (mean 41.5 days), however, PLD at Lord Howe Island was 58 days with high variance precluding significance. Also, there was no significant variation in PLD among years for either species despite considerable variation in East Australian Current strength. &&copy;2011 Springer-Verlag.;Cummings, D.O., Lee, R.W., Simpson, S.J., Booth, D.J., Pile, A.J. & Holmes, S.P. 2011, 'Resource partitioning amongst co-occurring decapods on wellheads from Australia's North-West shelf.

Stable isotope analysis was utilised to infer how eleven co-occurring decapods species partition trophic resources and to describe their trophic positions. Examination of?13C signatures revealed that some species were specialised in their resource use. For example, the shrimp Rhynchocinetes balssi and the crab Petrolisthes militaris consistently specialised in distinctive components of the resource base compared to other co-occurring decapods. Analysis of?15N signatures indicated that the species occupied similar trophic levels. However comparison amongst wellheads revealed that animals at deeper locations (136-152m) were more enriched than shallower locations (82-84m), which is likely to arise from the microbial degradation of particulate organic matter descending from the photic zone. &&copy;2011 Elsevier B.V.;Madin, E.M.P., Madin, J.S. & Booth, D.J. 2011, 'Landscape of fear visible from space', Scientific Reports, vol. 1.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;By linking ecological theory with freely-available Google Earth satellite imagery, landscape-scale footprints of behavioural interactions between predators and prey can be observed remotely. A Google Earth image survey of the lagoon habitat at Heron Island within Australia's Great Barrier Reef revealed distinct halo patterns within algal beds surrounding patch reefs. Ground truth surveys confirmed that, as predicted, algal canopy height increases with distance from reef edges. A grazing assay subsequently demonstrated that herbivore grazing was responsible for this pattern. In conjunction with recent behavioural ecology studies, these findings demonstrate that herbivores' collective antipredator behavioural patterns can shape vegetation distributions on a scale clearly visible from space. By using sequential Google Earth images of specific locations over time, this technique could potentially allow rapid, inexpensive remote monitoring of cascading, indirect effects of predator removals (e.g., fishing, hunting) and/or recovery and reintroductions (e.g., marine or terrestrial reserves) nearly anywhere on earth.;Booth, D.J., Bond, N. & MacReadie, P. 2011, 'Detecting range shifts among Australian fishes in response to climate change', Marine and Freshwater Research, vol. 62, no. 9, pp. 1027-1042.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;One of the most obvious and expected impacts of climate change is a shift in the distributional range of organisms, which could have considerable ecological and economic consequences. Australian waters are hotspots for climate-induced environmental changes, here, we review these potential changes and their apparent and potential implications for freshwater, estuarine and marine fish. Our meta-analysis detected 300 papers globally on 'fish' and 'range shifts', with?7% being from Australia. Of the Australian papers, only one study exhibited definitive evidence of climate-induced range shifts, with most studies focussing instead on future predictions. There was little consensus in the literature regarding the definition of 'range', largely because of populations having distributions that fluctuate regularly. For example, many marine populations have broad dispersal of offspring (causing vagrancy). Similarly, in freshwater and estuarine systems, regular environmental changes (e.g. seasonal, ENSO cycles not related to climate change) cause expansion and contraction of populations, which confounds efforts to detect range 'shifts'. We found that increases in water temperature, reduced freshwater flows and changes in ocean currents are likely to be the key drivers of climate-induced range shifts in Australian fishes. Although large-scale frequent and rigorous direct surveys of fishes across their entire distributional ranges, especially at range edges, will be essential to detect range shifts of fishes in response to climate change, we suggest careful co-opting of fisheries, museum and other regional databases as a potential, but imperfect alternative. &&copy;2011 CSIRO Open Access.;MacReadie, P.I., Bishop, M.J. & Booth, D.J. 2011, 'Implications of climate change for macrophytic rafts and their hitchhikers', Marine Ecology Progress Series, vol. 443, pp. 285-292.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Most models predicting changes to species distributions under future climate scenarios ignore dispersal processes, despite their importance in determining community structure in both terrestrial and aquatic systems ('supply-side ecology'). In the marine environment, facilitation of long-distance dispersal of coastal organisms by macrophytic rafts may be severely modified by climate impacts on raft supply, quality, and persistence, and on transport processes. Increasing storminess in the coastal zone, higher water temperatures, and changes in water circulation represent some of the key mechanisms that will directly affect rafts, while increases in herbivore metabolism due to higher water temperatures are likely to indirectly reduce raft longevity through raft consumption. Accurate predictions of climate impacts on coastal biodiversity will be con - tingent on resolution of factors influencing rafting so that this and other dispersal mechanisms can be incorporated into species distribution models. &&copy;2011 Inter-Research.;Figueira, W.F. & Booth, D.J. 2010, 'Increasing ocean temperatures allow tropical fishes to survive overwinter in temperate waters', Global Change Biology, vol. 16, no. 2, pp. 506-516.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The southeast coast of Australia is a global hotspot for increasing ocean temperatures due to climate change. The temperate incursion of the East Australian Current (EAC) is increasing, affording increased connectivity with the Great Barrier Reef. The survival of tropically sourced juveniles over the winter is a significant stumbling block to poleward range shifts of marine organisms in this region. Here we examine the dependence of overwintering on winter severity and prewinter recruitment for eight species of juvenile coral reef fishes which are carried into temperate SE Australia (30-371S) by the EAC during the austral summer. The probability of persistence was most strongly influenced by average winter temperature and there was no effect of recruitment strength. Long-term (138 years) data indicate that winter water temperatures throughout this region are increasing at a rate above the global average and predictions indicate a further warming of 2 &&deg;C by the end of the century. Rising ocean temperatures are resulting in a higher frequency of winter temperatures above survival thresholds. Current warming trajec-tories predict 100% of winters will be survivable by at least five of the study species as far south as Sydney (34&&deg;S) by 2080.

It indicates that animal behaviour is much less flexible than usually assumed, and suggests that individuals consistently differ in the way they perceive and react to changes in the environment. There is evidence of animal personality in a wide variety of animal taxa, including many freshwater fish species, but there seems to be very little evidence for this phenomenon in marine fish. To address this paucity, we repeatedly measured 3 behavioural traits of 2 temperate marine damselfish species, Parma microlepis and P. unifasciata, over a 2 wk period. Consistent individual differences in boldness, aggressiveness and activity were observed in both species, but average levels of these traits did not differ between species. A correlation between personality traits was also observed, with bolder individuals also tending to be more aggressive. The existence of personality in marine fish has implications for practical issues such as sampling bias, vulnerability to harvest and links between personality and lifehistory traits that affect fitness. &&copy;Inter-Research 2010.;Cummings, D.O., Booth, D.J., Lee, R.W., Simpson, S.J. & Pile, A.J. 2010, 'Ontogenetic diet shifts in the reef fish Pseudanthias rubrizonatus from isolated populations on the North-West Shelf of Australia', Marine Ecology Progress Series, vol. 419, pp. 211-222.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The red-barred anthias Pseudanthias rubrizonatus is a common tropical deep reef fish species found in Australia, but little is known about its dietary preferences and trophic interactions. We examined the gut contents and stable isotope signatures (?13C and?15N) of P. rubrizonatus from populations on the North-West Shelf of Australia to determine differences in diet relative to site, depth and fish size. We sampled 5 fish populations from a series of sub-sea structures, from 82 to 152 m depth, which had been submerged for up to 15 yr. Gut content analysis suggested that P. rubrizonatus displays an opportunistic feeding strategy and utilises both pelagic and benthic resources, including larval fishes, heteropods, isopods and mysids. Stable isotope analyses revealed that at all depths P. rubrizonatus underwent an ontogenetic diet shift. Values for?13C in muscle ranged from -19.7% for small fish to -16.2% for larger individuals, and?15N ranged from 8.2% for smaller fish to 13.2% for larger fish, indicating that a diet shift occurs at the end of juvenile development between 30 and 50 mm standard length. By simultaneously analysing gut contents and stable isotope signatures of the collected specimens, we have documented opportunistic dietary strategies that may assist P. rubrizonatus to colonise isolated structures. &&copy;Inter-Research 2010.;Buckle, E.C. & Booth, D.J. 2009, 'Ontogeny of space use and diet of two temperate damselfish species, Parma microlepis and Parma unifasciata', Marine Biology, vol. 156, no. 7, pp. 1497-1505.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Studies of reef fish herbivory have mainly focused on the impacts and behaviour of adults of tropical species. In this study, the ontogenetic shifts in home range, aggression, feeding rate, diet and gut morphology in juveniles and adults of two temperate territorial damselfishes, Parma microlepis and Parma unifasciata, were determined. Both P. microlepis and P. unifasciata juveniles under 80 mm TL exhibited no aggressive chases towards conspecifics or other species, while above 80 mm TL aggressive chase frequency increased in conjunction with an increase in home range, defended as a territory. Ontogenetic diet shifts, characterised by an increase in herbivory (P. unifasciata: juveniles: 64% plant material, adults: 95% plant material, P. microlepis: juveniles: 43% plant material, adults: 67% plant material) were observed for both species. The ratio of digestive tract length to body length, which often accompanies a switch to herbivory, increased significantly with ontogeny for both species. Compared to tropical confamilial grazers, these temperate damselfish species feeding rates were lower, and they had larger territories which were not as strongly defended (fewer aggressive chases). &&copy;2009 Springer-Verlag.;Figueira, W.F., Biro, P., Booth, D.J. & Valenzuela, V.C. 2009, 'Performance of tropical fish recruiting to temperate habitats: Role of ambient temperature and implications of climate change', Marine Ecology Progress Series, vol. 384, pp. 231-239.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The warming of coastal oceans due to climate change is increasing the overwinter survival of tropical fishes transported to temperate latitudes by ocean currents. However, the processes governing early post-arrival mortality are complex and can result in minimum threshold temperatures for overwinter survival, which are greater than those predicted based upon physiological temperature tolerances alone. This 3.5 mo laboratory study monitored the early performance of a tropical damselfish Abudefduf vaigiensis that occurs commonly during austral summer along the SE Australian coast, under nominal summer and winter water temperatures, and compares results with a co-occurring year-round resident of the same family, Parma microlepis. Survivorship, feeding rate, growth and burst swimming ability (as a measure of predator escape ability) were all reduced for the tropical species at winter water temperatures compared to those in summer, whereas the temperate species experienced no mortality and only feeding rate was reduced at colder temperatures. These results suggest that observed minimum threshold survival temperatures may be greater than predicted by physiology alone, due to lowered food intake combined with increased predation risk (a longer time at vulnerable sizes and reduced escape ability). Overwinter survival is a significant hurdle in pole-ward range expansions of tropical fishes, and a better understanding of its complex processes will allow for more accurate predictions of changes in biodiversity as coastal ocean temperatures continue to increase due to climate change.;Biro, P.A. & Booth, D.J. 2009, 'Extreme boldness precedes starvation mortality in six-lined trumpeter (Pelates sexlineatus)', Hydrobiologia, vol. 635, no. 1, pp. 395-398.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Fishes are often subjected to seasonal and spatial patchiness of food sources. We tested how risk-taking behaviour in the six-lined trumpeter, an estuarine seagrass resident fish, changed with hunger level in a laboratory experiment. When repeatedly offered a risky source of food, well-fed fish did not approach it and all fish survived over a one-month trial. In contrast, fish deprived of all food boldly first approached the risky food source after only a few days without food in some cases, or after many days in other cases, and then continued to approach risky food each time it was presented. Larger individuals were more bold (and had longer starvation endurance) than smaller ones, and after statistically controlling for these size effects, there were consistent individual differences in the propensity to take risks (i.e. boldness). These results show that food- and individual-dependent boldness will together affect vulnerability to predators and influence predation rates when resources become scarce. &&copy;Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.;Figueira, W.F., Booth, D.J. & Gregson, M.A. 2008, 'Selective mortality of a coral reef damselfish: Role of predator-competitor synergisms', Oecologia, vol. 156, no. 1, pp. 215-226.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Phenotypic variability within cohorts of juvenile organisms can serve as the basis for selective mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated the important role that predators play in this process but not the impact of competitors on selective predation. We use a combination of lab and field studies to evaluate the effect of the presence of adult competitor damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus and Pomacentrus moluccensis, family Pomacentridae) on the selective mortality of newly-arrived (settled) lemon damselfish (P. moluccensis) by resident predator fishes (Pseudochromis fuscus Pseudochromidae and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus Apogonidae). Lab trials consisted of mesocosm experiments in which the behaviour, mortality, and physiological condition (measured as lipid content) of surviving P. moluccensis settlers from each of three treatments: (1) predators absent, (2) predators present, and (3) predators and competitors present, were compared. The field study involved stocking newly settled P. moluccensis on natural bommies (patch reefs) which had either been subject to a partial removal of resident fish (predators and competitors) or left alone. Results indicated there was very strong condition-based selective mortality in both the lab and field trials. In both cases there was a strong positive relationship between mortality and the lipid content of surviving fish, implying low-condition fish were selectively removed. The mesocosm trials indicated that the strength of mortality as well as condition selectivity was higher when competitors were present than when they were absent. Behavioural observations in the mesocosm study suggest that attention by juvenile P. moluccensis to the movements and occasional chases of the competitors (especially D. aruanus) reduced their vigilance to the predators. These results suggest the important and interactive roles which condition of newly settled reef fish and interspecific competition can play in the outcomes of post-settlement pr...;Wressnig, A. & Booth, D.J. 2008, 'Patterns of seagrass biomass removal by two temperate Australian fishes (Monacanthidae)', Marine and Freshwater Research, vol. 59, no. 5, pp. 408-417.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Despite the global significance of nearshore seagrass beds, little is known of their trophodynamic processes. Herbivory by seagrass fishes is thought to be significant but some species previously suspected to be herbivores may be largely detritivorous. Patterns of grazing on the seagrass Posidonia australis by two abundant monacanthid fishes, Meuschenia freycineti and Meuschenia trachylepis, were determined by calculating the removal of seagrass biomass in three Australian estuaries over 14 months. M. freycineti removed significantly more seagrass biomass than M. trachylepis but seagrass biomass removed by both species varied widely across the three estuaries over time. Median amounts of seagrass removal were generally low for all sites compared with standing stock biomass of P. australis leaves and its epiphytes. Nevertheless, grazing by the two species caused high localised rates of removal (up to 90 mg dry weight of P. australis with epibiota per m2) in winter, the season when seagrass growth is least. Such removal rates are far greater than those reported for any other fish grazer in P. australis. These two fish species directly affect seagrass biomass and potentially alter the trophodynamics of P. australis seagrass beds, especially when grazing intensity is high during the season of lowest seagrass growth. &&copy;CSIRO 2008.;Booth, D.J., Figueira, W.F., Gregson, M.A., Brown, L. & Beretta, G. 2007, 'Occurrence of tropical fishes in temperate southeastern Australia: Role of the East Australian Current', Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, vol. 72, no. 1-2, pp. 102-114.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Dispersal of larval propagules is the major mechanism facilitating connectivity of marine populations. However, only a fraction of larvae settle in suitable habitat. For coral reef fishes, many larvae are advected away from coral reefs, often despite strong behavioural mechanisms (including swimming), and some may travel long distances away from the tropics. Here we document the occurrence of tropical reef fishes along the southeast coast of Australia between 2003 and 2005 and evaluate the role of the East Australian Current (EAC) in driving this pattern. In total we observed 47 species of tropical fishes from 11 families during the summer recruitment season (January to May) at locations spanning most of the length of the New South Wales coast (28&&deg;S-37.5&&deg;S latitude,?1700 km from the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef). Southern locations tended to have reduced richness and density relative to northern ones. In general, the southward extent of distribution of the most commonly observed species was well explained by their planktonic larval durations. Recruitment events tended to be much more episodic in Merimbula (37&&deg;S) than Sydney (34&&deg;S), but there was little evidence for interannual similarity in the spatial patterns of recruitment of individual species with exception of the numerical dominance of Abudefduf vaigiensis and Abudefduf sexfasciatus (Pomacentridae) at the Sydney location and of Chaetodon auriga and Chaetodon flavirostris (Chaetodontidae) at the Merimbula location. Despite strong evidence for the role of the EAC in the transport of these species at a coastal scale, we found little evidence that individual recruitment events were correlated with local increases in water temperature that would be associated with EAC ingress. &&copy;2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, projections of climate impacts will require a better mechanistic understanding of ecological and behavioral responses to climate change and climate variation. For vertebrate animals, there is an absence of whole-system manipulative experiments that express natural variation in predator and prey behaviors. Here we investigate the effect of elevated water temperature on the physiology, behavior, growth, and survival of fish populations in a multiple whole-lake experiment, by using 17 lake-years of data collected over 2 years with differing average temperatures. We found that elevated temperatures in excess of the optimum reduced the scope for growth through reduced maximum consumption and increased metabolism in young rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Increased metabolism at high temperatures resulted in increased feeding activity (consumption) by individuals to compensate and maintain growth rates similar to that observed at cooler (optimum) temperatures. However, greater feeding activity rates resulted in greater vulnerability to predators that reduced survival to only half that of the cooler year. Our work therefore identifies temperature-dependent physiology and compensatory feeding behavior as proximate mechanisms for substantial climate-induced mortality in fish populations at the scale of entire populations and waterbodies. &&copy;2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.;Wressnig, A. & Booth, D.J. 2007, 'Feeding preferences of two seagrass grazing monacanthid fishes', Journal of Fish Biology, vol. 71, no. 1, pp. 272-278.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Two seagrass grazing fishes, Meuschenia freycineti and Meuschenia trachylepis (Monacanthidae), were offered three choices of Posidonia australis seagrass blades of different epiphyte coverage and leaf age to determine whether these fishes exhibit a preference for epiphyte-covered seagrass blades. Both species removed significantly more biomass of the epiphyte-covered blades than of the two other blade types in multiple-choice tests. This clear preference for epiphyte-covered seagrass blades results in a preferred removal of older blades within the seagrass shoot of P. australis. &&copy;2007 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.;Alquezar, R., Markich, S.J. & Booth, D.J. 2006, 'Effects of metals on condition and reproductive output of the smooth toadfish in Sydney estuaries, south-eastern Australia', Environmental Pollution, vol. 142, no. 1, pp. 116-122.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;This study determined the condition and reproductive output of a common estuarine toadfish, Tetractenos glaber, in two metal contaminated and two reference estuaries near Sydney, Australia. Female toadfish from metal contaminated estuaries were smaller and younger than in reference estuaries, however, it could not be resolved whether these differences were due to direct effects of metal contamination or differences in nutritional value of prey. Lipid content in liver and gonad tissues was inversely related with levels of As, Pb, Cd and Co in sediment. In contrast, protein content in liver, gonad and muscle tissues was positively related to sediment levels of Ni and Co. Increased levels of Pb in gonads were associated with decreased oocyte diameter and density. This suggests a reduction in egg size and fecundity, which ultimately may lead to a decline in female reproductive output.

The introduction of the invasive green alga Caulerpa taxifolia could potentially threaten the seagrasses of south-eastern Australia. This study examined the implications of the spread of C. taxifolia on ichthyofauna in 2 estuaries in central New South Wales. Fish assemblages were compared among adjacent habitats of C. taxifolia and 2 seagrass species (Posidonia australis and Zostera capricorni). Fish were sampled using a small beam trawl to test for differences among habitats in (1) the species composition of the fish assemblages, (2) total abundance and species richness of fishes, and (3) abundances of major fish families. Fish assemblages separated into 3 significantly distinct groupings based on habitat. Total abundances of fishes were similar among habitats, however, species richness was lower in C. taxifolia. The fish assemblages in C. taxifolia were largely characterised by high abundances of gobiid fishes, similar to those in Z. capricorni, and few or no syngnathid and monacanthid species when compared to seagrass fish assemblages. This suggests that if C. taxifolia competitively replaces native seagrass beds in the estuaries of New South Wales, the resulting change in habitat may also cause a change in fish assemblages. This could reduce the abundances of some protected and economically important fish species but may also increase abundances of other opportunistic fishes. &&copy;Inter-Research 2006.;Tucker, B.J., Booth, M.A., Allan, G.L., Booth, D. & Fielder, D.S. 2006, 'Effects of photoperiod and feeding frequency on performance of newly weaned Australian snapper Pagrus auratus', Aquaculture, vol. 258, no. 1-4, pp. 514-520.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;An experiment was done to investigate the interactive effects of photoperiod (12L:12D or 18L:6D) and feeding frequency on the growth of newly weaned Australian snapper (mean weight = 0.14&&nbsp;g fish- 1).

Fish that died were counted but not replaced. Photoperiod, feeding frequency and the interaction of these factors significantly affected the individual harvest weight and thermal growth coefficient (TGC) of snapper.

Weight gain and TGC were best in snapper reared under a 18L:6D photoperiod regime and fed 8 feeds day- 1, however, weight gain did not plateau, suggesting further increases in weight gain may be possible if feeding frequencies greater then 8F are employed.

While resource-dependent models, which consider only instantaneous prey density in modelling predator responses, predict community responses that are dependent on the number of trophic levels in a system, ratio-dependent models, which consider the number of prey per consumer, predict proportional increase in each level irrespective of chain length. The two models are only subtly different for systems with two or three trophic levels but in the case of four trophic levels, predict opposite effects of enrichment on primary producers. Despite the poor discriminatory power of tests of the models in systems with two or three trophic levels, field tests in estuarine and marine systems with four trophic levels have been notably absent. Sampling of phytoplankton, macroinvertebrates, invertebrate-feeding fishes, piscivorous fishes in Kooloonbung Creek, Hastings River estuary, eastern Australia, subject to over 20 years of sewage discharge, revealed increased abundances in all four trophic levels at the disturbed location relative to control sites. Increased abundance of phytoplankton at the disturbed site was counter to the predictions of resource-dependent models, which posit a reduction in the first trophic level in response to enrichment. By contrast, the increase in abundance of this first trophic level and the proportionality of increases in abundances of each of the four trophic groups to nitrogen loading provided strong support for ratio dependency. This first evidence of ratio dependence in an estuarine system with four trophic levels not only demonstrates the applicability of ecological theory which seeks to simplify the complexity of systems, but has implications for management.

Although the weedy seadragon Phyllopteryx taeniolatus (Lacepede, 1804), a syngnathid fish endemic to southern Australia, is legally protected in New South Wales, there are no studies on population density, habitat use and behaviour to support this protection. We investigated the abundance, sex ratios and distribution of the weedy seadragon at three sites near Sydney, Australia. The distribution, density and sex ratios of seadragons were temporally stable, suggesting no large-scale seasonal migrations. Estimated population densities varied among sites from 10 individuals per ha to 65 individuals per ha, with sex ratios close to 1:1. Survival rates from one encounter to the next (approximately weekly) were high, being slightly lower for males (0.985 &&plusmn;0.006, mean &&plusmn;se) and females (0.987 &&plusmn;0.005) compared with juveniles (1.000 &&plusmn;0.000). All size classes and both sexes were most common near the border of kelp and sand except when exhibiting hiding behaviour, when they were more often found in kelp beds. Kelp beds were the least-used habitat when feeding. Pregnant males tended to hide more often than other groups and therefore were more frequently found in kelp and kelp patches. Seadragons tended to be solitary, although pairing and grouping behaviour was also observed. Results of the present study show that weedy seadragons are resident in the same area throughout the year and have a strong affinity with heavily weeded rock and/or sand habitat. It is therefore recommended that the current species-based protection laws be used in concert with habitat-protection zones as a necessary measure to ensure the conservation of weedy seadragon populations. &&copy;CSIRO 2006.;Alquezar, R., Markich, S.J. & Booth, D.J. 2006, 'Metal accumulation in the smooth toadfish, Tetractenos glaber, in estuaries around Sydney, Australia', Environmental Pollution, vol. 142, no. 1, pp. 123-131.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;This study determined the metal levels in sediments and tissues of a common estuarine fish, Tetractenos glaber (smooth toadfish), from two metal contaminated and two reference estuaries near Sydney, Australia. Metal levels were highest in sediments and fish from contaminated estuaries. Gonads contained the highest metal levels followed by muscle, gill and liver. Metal accumulation was gender-dependant (e.g. male gonads were 20 times higher in As than females, female gills were 30 times higher than males for Pb). Cadmium, Pb and Ni levels in fish tissues reflected sediment levels, indicating sediment and/or dietary metal uptake. Levels of As, Co, Cd & Pb in gills showed similar patterns to other tissues, suggesting that metals may have been taken up by gills through contaminated water. Similar metal patterns in tissues and sediments suggest more than one uptake pathway. This study indicates that multiple factors influence metal accumulation in fish. &&copy;2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A suite of endocrine-disruptive chemicals (DECs) has been shown to mimic sex hormones in vertebrates and their presence is an important bioindicator of environmental degradation. We examined expression of vitellogenin (Vtg, a female yolk protein) in male toadfish (Tetratenos glaber), as an indicator of EDC presence in estuaries around Sydney, Australia. First we demonstrated induction of Vtg in males from unpolluted estuarine sites through injection of 17beta-oestradiol. Second, serum of fish from polluted and unpolluted estuaries was collected and examined by reducing-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). While females from polluted (downstream from sewage treatment plants, and subject to urban runoff) and less polluted sites all expressed Vtg in blood serum, males from less polluted sites showed little or no evidence of Vtg expression. however, most males from heavilty polluted sites showed moderate to high levels of vtg expression indicating that EDCs were present and affecting normal endocrine function in males. We suggest that simple biochemical examinations of EDS effects, such as vtg induction in males, are useful rapid assessment methods wich can provide evidence upon which further, more detailed studies may be undertaken.;Walsh, C.T., Pease, B.C., Hoyle, S.D. & Booth, D.J. 2006, 'Variability in growth of longfinned eels among coastal catchments of south-eastern Australia', Journal of Fish Biology, vol. 68, no. 6, pp. 1693-1706.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Longfinned eels Anguilla reinhardtii were captured by both fishery-dependent and independent sampling methods from three rivers in New South Wales, south-eastern Australia. Growth rates were examined in two zones (fresh water and tidal) in the Hacking, Hawkesbury and Clarence Rivers. Mean annual growth increments of sampled longfinned eels ranged from 30 to 60 mm year-1 using age-length analyses and up to 167 mm year-1 based on tag-recapture model estimates (GROTAG), with both methods showing high intra- and inter-population variability. Growth was significantly faster in younger (5-15 years) fish than older (15 years) fish, with females growing an average 10 mm year-1 faster than males of similar age and capture location. Longfinned eels found in tidal areas grew significantly faster than those in non-tidal freshwater areas as a result of longer growing seasons in the highly productive estuarine habitats. Other possible factors influencing variability in growth rates for this species include habitat preference, density and fishing pressure. &&copy;2006 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.;Sanchez-Camara, J., Booth, D.J. & Turon, X. 2005, 'Reproductive cycle and growth of Phyllopteryx taeniolatus', Journal of Fish Biology, vol. 67, no. 1, pp. 133-148.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;In this study, 36 males, 33 females and 15 juveniles of the common or weedy seadragon Phyllopteryx taeniolatus, a syngnathid fish endemic to the waters of southern Australia, were identified using visual implant fluorescent elastomer tags and pattern of appendages and their reproductive cycle and growth was studied from May 2001 to June 2002. Brooding males were present for a period of 6 months, from June-July to early-January. The percentage of males that were pregnant in the studied areas peaked in November-December, near the end of the breeding season. Two pregnancies were reported for some males. Ten recruits were identified from November to June. Growth rates for young-of-the-year, young of the previous year, males and females were measured.

The temperate Sydney (Australia) reef fish species Trachinops taeniatus was investigated between February and September 2002 to determine whether there was a relationship between shoal dynamics and zooplankton prey distribution. The diet of T. taeniatus consisted mainly of Copepoda. T. taeniatus shoals were strongly associated with the largest patches of Copepoda, with shoal size increasing as prey density increased. Available Copepoda per fish, however, decreased with shoal size, presenting a possible 'overmatching' foraging situation. The present study suggests there may be an optimum shoal size to achieve maximum prey intake, and that shoal location and size may be linked to the distribution of zooplankton prey. &&copy;Inter-Research 2005.;Sanchez-Camara, J. & Booth, D.J. 2004, 'Movement, home range and site fidelity of the weedy seadragon Phyllopteryx taeniolatus (Teleostei: Syngnathidae)', Environmental Biology of Fishes, vol. 70, no. 1, pp. 31-41.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;We measured for the first time movement, home range and site fidelity of the protected and endemic Australian fish weedy seadragon Phyllopteryx taeniolatus. Ninety-two individuals were identified using visual implant fluorescent elastomer and studied over a one-year period. Identified animals remained at the same site over the year within limited home ranges. These home ranges and the movement patterns recorded were independent of sex although movement to shallow sheltered waters to hatch the young was observed at the end of the breeding season for some pregnant males. The site fidelity and restricted home range of the weedy seadragon, as well as the reproduction-related movement have implications for effective management of this protected species.;Booth, D.J. 2004, 'Synergistic effects of conspecifics and food on growth and energy allocation of a damselfish', Ecology, vol. 85, no. 10, pp. 2881-2887.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Grouping organisms may suffer reduced growth due to food deprivation in the presence of larger conspecifics, but this cost can be outweighed by advantages of reduced predation risk in larger groups. Here, tagged new juveniles of a small, grouping damselfish Dascyllus aruanus, were added to small coral heads that were either empty or supported small groups of larger conspecifics. Half of the coral heads with conspecifics and half of those without were subjected daily to additions of brine shrimp, similar to natural zooplankton food, over a three-week period. Growth was measured as increase in body length, change in body condition (lipid content), and overall energy gain. Body lipid reserves were higher (21%) in recruits subjected to added food and in the presence of conspecifics (13%). Total energy was higher (53%) in recruits with added food but was not affected by conspecific presence. There was an interaction between conspecific presence and food supplementation treatment on change in body length, a commonly used growth estimator. These differences suggest that the benefits of extra food and effects of conspecific presence differ depending on the metric used to measure growth, but that presence of larger conspecifics enhanced the increased growth that resulted from higher food intake.;Silberschneider, V., Pease, B.C. & Booth, D.J. 2004, 'Estuarine habitat preferences of Anguilla australis and A. reinhardtii glass eels as inferred from laboratory experiments', Environmental Biology of Fishes, vol. 71, no. 4, pp. 395-402.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;We tested the habitat preferences of Anguillaaustralis (shortfin) and A. reinhardtii (longfin) glass eels using circular tanks in an aquarium, containing four types of estuarine habitat (sand, mud, rocks/cobbles and seagrass). Shortfin eels either showed a tendency to occur in heterogeneous habitats, or in rocks/cobbles. Longfin glass eels showed a significant preference for rocks/cobbles in both experiments. Tests on shortfin and longfin glass eels in tanks with only rocks/cobbles available showed that eels were not clumped, indicating that individuals select habitat for re-settlement independently. Therefore, we assumed that the uneven distribution of glass eels observed in the habitat type experiments were the result of habitat preference. Given a choice of habitats in tank experiments, shortfin and longfin glass eels preferred habitats containing structure, and in particular, rocks/cobbles.;Booth, D.J. & Beretta, G.A. 2004, 'Influence of recruit condition on food competition and predation risk in a coral reef fish', Oecologia, vol. 140, no. 2, pp. 289-294.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Settlement rate is considered to be a major determinant of the population structure of coral reef fishes. In this study, the effects of larval physiological condition on survival, predation risk and competitive ability are assessed for a small damselfish, Pomacentrus moluccensis. New settlers were collected and fed for 5 days to produce high and low condition (measured as lipid) treatment fish. In a field experiment, pairs (one high and one low condition fish) were transplanted to corals. Persistence over 2 weeks was much higher (100% vs. 25%) in high condition fish. In mixed groups in the laboratory, high condition fish were both aggressively dominant and consumed more of a limiting prey source than low condition fish. In addition, low condition fish were shown to be at much higher risk of predation. All of the low condition fish but only 33% of high condition fish in mixed groups were consumed by fish predators, and in a separate experiment, 73% of feeding strikes by predators were directed at low condition fish. Quality of new settlers can have an important influence on subsequent juvenile survival. The mechanisms for this effect are likely to include a combination of effects of condition on food competition and predation risk. &&copy;Springer-Verlag 2004.;Walsh, C.T., Pease, B.C. & Booth, D.J. 2004, 'Variation in the sex ratio, size and age of longfinned eels within and among coastal catchments of south-eastern Australia', Journal of Fish Biology, vol. 64, no. 5, pp. 1297-1312.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Longfinned eels Anguilla reinhardtii were captured by both fishery-dependent and independent sampling methods from three rivers in New South Wales, south-eastern Australia.

Females were found in relatively high proportions in all zones, ranging from 97% in a freshwater (non-tidal) site down to 59% in a tidal site. Males were found primarily in tidal zones (only two of the 677 longfinned eels caught in non-tidal fresh water were males), with the greatest proportions being found in the brackish upper tidal areas.

We added approximately 600 recruit-sized individuals onto coral reef that parallels patterns in naturally settling fish. Strong, positive density-dependent mortality occurred 3 days, 1-2 weeks, and 4 months after release. Since our study species was patchily distributed, we estimated both mean group size and overall density in a transect. Mortality was more strongly related to mean group size than overall density in a transect, indicating that recruit patchiness was important. Cohesive groups may suffer higher mortality than those spread over larger areas, even if overall density of the latter is greater. Aggregative responses of predators may occur in response to larger groups, so may have contributed to positive density-dependent mortality. Increased conspicuousness to predators and congeneric aggression are additional factors that may vary positively with group size. Tagging of recruits showed migration within but not between transects, so persistence was tantamount to survival. Standard otolith back-calculation techniques employed to reconstruct original size of tagged recruits that persisted 4 months after additions indicated that mortality was also size-dependent. Size-dependent mortality was apparent at the site with the highest mortality but not at the site with the lowest mortality, resulting in different mean body sizes of recruits between sites. Size-dependent mortality may influence estimation of growth and lead to onset of size-based maturity in these fish. Strong, positive density-dependent mortality may regulate recruitment, and if coupled with size-dependent mortality, may increase maturity rate, adding to reproductive schedules of those that survive.;Walsh, C.T., Pease, B.C. & Booth, D.J. 2003, 'Sexual dimorphism and gonadal development of the Australian longfinned river eel', Journal of Fish Biology, vol. 63, no. 1, pp. 137-152.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The sex and stage of gonadal development of longfinned river eels Anguilla reinhardtii, captured from nine river catchments in New South Wales, Australia, between 1999 and 2001, were determined macroscopically. Sex was verified by histology. Histology was also necessary, however, to accurately define stages of gonadal development, particularly in individuals 600 mm in total body length. Anguilla reinhardtii displayed asynchronous gamete development. The most advanced cells present in migrating male and female A. reinhardtii were spermatocytes and previtellogenic oocytes, respectively. Gonadal development stages were positively correlated with body size in both sexes. Females, however, were significantly larger than males and their gonads matured over a broader size range. Size at sexual differentiation (42-60cm for males and 50-76cm for females) was much larger than for most other anguillids that have been studied, with the exception of the New Zealand longfinned eel Anguilla dieffenbachii. Corresponding with its large range in size at sexual differentiation was a relatively large range in size at migration for both males (44-62cm) and females (74-142cm). &&copy;2003 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.;Upston, J. & Booth, D.J. 2003, 'Settlement and density of juvenile fish assemblages in natural, Zostera capricorni (Zosteraceae) and artificial seagrass beds', Environmental Biology of Fishes, vol. 66, no. 1, pp. 91-97.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Few studies have validated the use of artificial seagrass to study processes structuring faunal assemblages by comparison with natural seagrass. One metric (fish recruitment) for evaluating the use of artificial seagrass was used in the present study. Settlement and recruitment of juvenile fish was estimated in natural, Zostera capricorni Aschers, and artificial seagrass in Botany Bay, NSW, over 6 consecutive days. Tarwhine, Rhabdosargus sarba, dominated the catch from both habitats, and there was no significant difference in abundance of recruits among the habitats. This was at least partly caused by large spatial and temporal variation in abundance. Daily abundances of R. sarba recruits suggested movement between seagrass beds, but could not be confirmed without tagging individual fish. Rhabdosargus sarba settlers were less abundant than recruits, but were also patchily distributed amongst natural and artificial seagrass beds. Most other species were also found in similar abundance in the two habitats, except stripey, Microcanthus strigatus, which was more abundant in artificial seagrass. Overall, fish assemblages in natural and artificial seagrass were similar. Artificial seagrass may therefore be useful for monitoring settlement and recruitment of juvenile fishes to disturbed habitats, to predict the success of habitat remediation. However, if artificial seagrass is used to model processes occurring in natural seagrass, it is necessary to consider species-specific responses to the artificial habitat.;Stauber, A.G. & Booth, D.J. 2003, 'Allometry in the Bearded Dragon Pogona barbata (sauria: Agamidae): Sex and geographic differences', Australian Zoologist, vol. 32, no. 2, pp. 238-245.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Allometry in size and shape between sexes was investigated in preserved Bearded Dragon Pogona barbata museum specimens. Measurements for snout-vent, head, leg and tail lenghts were obtained from 236 individuals ranging from hatchlings to large adults. Juveniles and adults were sexed, and size at onset of maturity was determined. Geographic variation in P. barbata was also studied by comparing lizards from three regions in New South Wales (NSW), which differ in annual rainfall. Relative to snout-vent length, head and leg lengths were in negative allometry in all specimens, and tail length was in positive allometry in juveniles, but negative in adults. Sexual dimorphism was evident in body size and shape. Males grew larger and reached maturity at larger sizes than females. While juvenile shape did not differ between the sexes, mature males had proportionately longer heads, legs and tails than adult females. This generalisation in sexual shape dimorphism did not hold true for animals from different NSW regions. Western males had proportionately longer legs and heads than western females, but relative tail lengths were not significantly different. Sexual dimorphism in body shape was not seen in the central animal group. In the east, heads and tails were longer in males than in females. Both sexes showed lower relative head and leg lenghts in more arid regions. We suggest that a combination of genetic drift and phenotypic responses are likely causes of these variations.;Booth, D.J. & Alquezar, R. 2002, 'Food supplemantation increases larval growth, condition and survival of Acanthochromis polyacanthus', Journal of Fish Biology, vol. 60, no.

In 1997-1998, wide-spread coral bleaching and mortality occurred across the Great Barrier Reef, caused by increases in sea surface temperatures resulting from El Ni&&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation. As part of this event, in February-March 1998, there was extensive bleaching within One Tree Island lagoon (southern Great Barrier Reef), such that almost 12 mo later there was a significant reduction of live coral cover at some sites. We monitored the distribution of adults and recruitment of damselfishes (Pomacentridae) to sites within One Tree Island in 1993-1995 and in 1999. Fish species that normally associate with live corals showed relatively lower recruitment at bleached sites compared to the same sites pre-bleaching or to recovered sites and, as a result, species diversity and assemblage structure of recruits changed. Compared to 1993/1995 densities, adult Pomacentrus wardi, P. moluccensis and Chrysiptera rollandi densities dropped at bleached sites, but not at unbleached sites. While P. moluccensis directly associate with live corals, the other 2 species do not. This study has demonstrated that indirect effects of bleaching can include changes in-assemblage structure of reef fish adults and recruits.;Booth, D.J. 2002, 'Distribution changes after settlement in six species of damselfish (Pomacentridae) in One Tree Island lagoon, Great Barrier Reef', Marine Ecology Progress Series, vol. 226, pp. 157-164.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;While larval supply patterns play a major role in determining the distribution and abundance of reef fishes at a range of spatial and temporal scales, events occurring in the weeks after settlement may also significantly alter the demography of a juvenile population. I monitored over 2 summers the arrival of new recruits of 6 species of benthic damselfish onto continuous and patch reef habitat in One Tree Island lagoon. Each species had specific habitat preferences, and most showed some form of patchiness in spatial and temporal distribution at settlement, however, this was most likely a result of group settlement rather than habitat patchiness. Tagged recruits of Pomacentrus amboinensis remained within 1 m of their settlement site for at least the first 36 d on continuous reef, while known individuals of other species also moved little during this period, suggesting that disappearances were likely to be due to mortality. Mortality of recruits varied among species, years and habitats (patch vs continuous reef), and consequently spatial distributions of fish changed after settlement at the scale of 10s of metres (within-site) and several kilometres (among 8 sites). The spatial patchiness in distributions was not consistent among species, sites or years, suggesting that spatial variation in substrate did not have a major effect on settlement variation at this scale. These results show that the settlement signal may be obscured in the first few weeks post-settlement, and that less-frequent censuses, commonly used as proxies for high-frequency monitoring of settlement, may not accurately hindcast spatial or temporal patterns of settlement.;Booth, D. & Alquezar, R. 2002, 'Food supplementation increases larval growth, condition and survival of Acanthochromis polyacanthus', Journal of Fish Biology, vol. 60, no. 5, pp. 1126-1133.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Supplementary feeding to damselfish Acanthochromis polyacanthus larvae, at One Tree Island on the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, led to increased growth in length and enhanced condition relative to unfed control larvae, although both groups dropped in body condition (measured as total lipids) over the experimental period. Survival of fry was enhanced in fed broods, with on average 60% survival over 20 days, compared to 46% survival in unfed broods. Growth, condition and survival were neither density-dependent nor body-size dependent within broods. This study suggests variation in food supply may strongly influence persistence of larvae to juvenile stages, and thus influence cohort size. &&copy;2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

Natural sediment physicochemical differences were assessed, along with low-level anthropogenic contaminants including copper, lead, zinc, phosphorus and nitrogen. Contaminant levels at all sites were below sediment guideline values for biological effects. Natural physicochemical sediment differences were the main determinants in species assemblage patterns among sites. Three groupings of sites with similar assemblages were observed during February 1998. Berowra Creek sites, which were higher in organic content and silt/clay (and thus metals and nutrients), higher in pH and lower in salinity, were similar in terms of contributions by the polychaetes Ceratoneresis aequisetis, Scoloplos normalis, the isopod Cyathura hakea and the bivalve mollusc Soletellina alba. Sites on upper Cowan Creek, higher in organic content, silt/clay (nutrients and metals) and lower in salinity, were similar and separated from other sites in terms of the polychaete Carazziella victoriensis and the gastropod mollusc Nassarius jonasii. Sites lower in Cowan Creek, tended to be higher in sand content, more saline and lower in organic content and thus nutrient and metal concentrations. These sites were similar in terms of contributions of the polychaete Sigalion bandaensis and the bivalve molluscs, Mysella vitrea and Tellina deltoidalis. The biotic assemblage patterns were not maintained temporally, suggesting the importance of monitoring over time to assess possible future impacts.

The rockpool fish community in Sydney was speciose (23 species), of which 35% of individuals were E. rufopileus. Fish abundance and 13 physical and biological parameters were measured in twenty-two rockpools spread among 4 sites. Abundance of E. rufopileus was best predicted by the number of rock overhangs, algal cover (Zonaria sp. and Hormosira banksii), and the encrusting ascidian cunjevoi (Pyura sp.). Experimental increase or decrease in available shelter (mainly boulders and macroalgae) in rockpools did not significantly affect the abundance of fishes, however some pools consistently supported more fishes in total, despite repeated defaunation, indicating that underlying deterministic processes may have a significant effect on rockpool fish communities. The diet of Enneapterygius rufopileus included unidentified crustacean remains, harpacticoid copepods, and gastropods. Gastropod abundance was greater in the diets of larger fish, which also consumed more food overall. Total weight of food was not dependent on E. rufopileus density in pools or the densities of all fish species in pools. Therefore, the study does not support the hypothesis that resources were limiting for this fish species in rockpools.;Koop, K., Booth, D., Broadbent, A., Brodie, J., Bucher, D., Capone, D., Coll, J., Dennison, W., Erdmann, M., Harrison, P., Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Hutchings, P., Jones, G.B., Larkum, A.W.D., O'Neil, J., Steven, A., Tentori, E., Ward, S., Williamson, J. & Yellowlees, D. 2001, 'ENCORE: The effect of nutrient enrichment on coral reefs. Synthesis of results and conclusions', Marine Pollution Bulletin, vol. 42, no. 2, pp. 91-120.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Coral reef degradation resulting from nutrient enrichment of coastal waters is of increasing global concern. Although effects of nutrients on coral reef organisms have been demonstrated in the laboratory, there is little direct evidence of nutrient effects on coral reef biota in situ. The ENCORE experiment investigated responses of coral reef organisms and processes to controlled additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) on an offshore reef (One Tree Island) at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. A multi-disciplinary team assessed a variety of factors focusing on nutrient dynamics and biotic responses. A controlled and replicated experiment was conducted over two years using twelve small patch reefs ponded at low tide by a coral rim. Treatments included three control reefs (no nutrient addition) and three+N reefs (NH4Cl added), three+P reefs (KH2PO4 added), and three+N+P reefs. Nutrients were added as pulses at each low tide (ca twice per day) by remotely operated units. There were two phases of nutrient additions. During the initial, low-loading phase of the experiment nutrient pulses (mean dose=11.5?MNH4 +, 2.3?MPO4 -3) rapidly declined, reaching near-background levels (mean=0.9?MNH4 +, 0.5?MPO4 -3) within 2-3 h. A variety of biotic processes, assessed over a year during this initial nutrient loading phase, were not significantly affected, with the exception of coral reproduction, which was affected in all nutrient treatments. In Acropora longicyathus and A. aspera, fewer successfully developed embryos were formed, and in A. longicyathus fertilization rates and lipid levels decreased. In the second, high-loading, phase of ENCORE an increased nutrient dosage (mean dose=36.2?MNH4 +, 5.1?MPO4 -3 declining to means of 11.3?MNH4 + and 2.4?MPO4 -3 at the end of low tide) was used for a further year, and a variety of significant biotic responses occurred.

Glass eels entered the collectors at night primarily during the flood tide, and did not move into the collectors during daylight hours. Glass eel abundance increased with increasing distance from the freshwater drain located in the causeway. The artificial habitat collectors are effective for assessing relative numbers of resettling glass eels and may be useful for studying recruitment and settlement patterns of other anguillid eel species, as well as identifying areas and habitats within a catchment that provide important shelter for glass eels.

Overall recruitment was 3 times higher in 1993/1994 than 1994/1995, and 1.5 times higher than 1999. In general, recruitment decreased towards the lagoon centre, even though habitat availability was not lower there on average, suggesting that most fish settled at outer sites as they were advected from adjacent waters. There was also great variation in numbers of recruits among outer sites. Patterns of recruitment to continuous reef and patch reef habitats also differed among species, suggesting habitat selection at this broad level. For example, Pomacentrus nagasakiensis was primarily found on patch reefs, while P. moluccensis was largely found on continuous reef. One site (Shark Alley) received the highest number of recruits of most species during the study, and this pattern has been observed in studies since 1975. Despite interannual variability in abundance of potential settlers and differences in the habitat preferences of some species, therefore, some sites on the reef can receive relatively high numbers of settlers over decadal time scales. This consistency of spatial pattern may be due to local topography and oceanography at Shark Alley, which appear to favour the input of potential settlers. The availability of live coral may also be important, but species which showed no preferences for live cover also recruited at high levels at this site. The attributes of Shark Alley were compared with those at other sites. Overall, sites that clustered on the basis of oceanographic and habitat features also had similar recruitment, suggesting that these features may be useful in predicting recruitment hotspots on reefs elsewhere.;Macfarlane, G.R., Booth, D.J. & Brown, K.R. 2000, 'The Semaphore Crab, Heloecius Cordiformis: Bio-Indication Potential for Heavy Metals in Estuarine Systems', Aquatic Toxicology, vol. 50, no. 0, pp. 1530166-0.;MacFarlane, G.R., Booth, D.J. & Brown, K.R. 2000, 'The Semaphore crab, Heloecius cordiformis: Bio-indication potential for heavy metals in estuarine systems', Aquatic Toxicology, vol. 50, no. 3, pp. 153-166.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Although alterations at the organism level in decapod crustaceans on exposure to heavy metals have been evidenced in the laboratory, little examination of metal effects on morphology and population parameters have been explored in a field-based situation. Relationships between morphological parameters, population demography and heavy metal sediment loadings were examined in conjunction with the accumulation of metals in the Semaphore crab, Heloecius cordiformis, in the Port Jackson and Hawkesbury River estuaries, Sydney, Australia. H. cordiformis exhibited sexual dimorphism, with males having larger carapace width, carapace length, chelae length and total mass than females. Sexes were subsequently treated separately to assess morphological differences among locations. Locations that had greater proportions of females with purple chelae and less females in the population tended to have higher sediment metal levels. These relationships were maintained over time, and could be employed as population-level biological indicators of heavy metal stress. Copper and zinc were regulated in the hepatopancreas of H. cordiformis. Lead was accumulated in the hepatopancreas of H. cordiformis in proportion to sediment lead levels, suggesting the species is both an appropriate candidate for bio-indication of lead pollution, and Pb is the main metal linked with population level differences. Accumulation of lead varied between sexes, indicating that sexes must be monitored separately. Smaller males accumulated more lead than larger males, suggesting size is an important consideration for lead accumulation.

However, spatial and temporal variation in condition (i.e. quality) of potential recruits, as well as their density (i.e. quantity), may influence survival and growth of juveniles. We conducted an experiment to test whether recent feeding history could affect growth, condition and post-recruitment survival in a Caribbean damselfish, Stegastes partitus. Fish were collected soon after settlement, and fed either low or high rations in aquaria for 7 days. Fish fed the high ration grew faster in aquaria and were in a better condition (higher total lipids and Fulton's condition factor) at the end of the feeding period. Subsequently, we released 50 fish in 25 pairs (one fish subjected to low rations, the other to high rations) on a Bahamian coral reef and monitored survival for 10 days. Survivorship of high-ration fish was double that of low-ration fish (80 vs 40% over 10 days). However, low-ration fish that survived 10 days were of similar condition and grew at similar rates to high-ration fish, suggesting that shortterm ration differences may not persist in surviving fish. Laboratory experiments showed that low-ration fish were taken by piscivorous fishes before high-ration fish, indicating that differential predation may account for survival differences. This study highlights the potential of feeding history and condition to affect the relationship between patterns of larval arrival at reefs, and subsequent juvenile and adult population densities.;Booth, D.J. & Schultz, D.L. 1999, 'Seasonal Ecology, Condition and Reproductive Patterns of the Smooth Toadfish Tetractenos glaber (Freminville) in the Hawkesbury Estuarine System, Australia', Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales, vol. 1999, no. 121, pp. 71-84.;Seasonal variation in population structure, diet, lipid condition and reproduction of the smooth toadfish, Tetractenos glaber, were monitored in Berowra Creek and Cowan Creek, two estuarine arms of the Hawkesbury River, New South Wales, Australia. Tetractenos glaber is site-specific, feeding on benthic mussels and crustaceans. Reproduction occurs in April-July (winter), preceded by a buildup of somatic lipids in both sexes in February-April (Autumn). The liver appears to be a major source of lipid mobilisation, with total lipids varying among individuals from 20 to 90% of liver dry weight, and from 6 to 30% for muscle tissue. Recruitment occurred in November, and populations were composed of individuals up to at least 13 years of age. Sex ratios fluctuated seasonally, with a higher proportion of females sampled in winter, and more males in summer. The site-specificity, high abundance and benthic foraging behaviour of T. glaber suggest that it is largely estuarine-resident, and make it a potential bioindicator of the effects of degraded water quality on estuarine biota.;Booth, D.J. & Wellington, G. 1998, 'Settlement preferences in coral-reef fishes: Effects on patterns of adult and juvenile distributions, individual fitness and population structure', Austral Ecology, vol. 23, no. 3, pp. 274-279.;Coral-reef fishes exhibit a wide range of habitat preferences at settlement. However, the consequences of these preferences to fitness and population dynamics are poorly known. We critically evaluate evidence for these consequences from recent studies of settlement preferences, and note that most studies have concentrated on only a few common taxa. We recommend that this taxonomic base be broadened, and that settlement preferences be incorporated into future studies of the link between larval supply and population dynamics of reef fishes.;Booth, D. 1998, 'Teaching evolution are we getting through?', Australasian Science, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 40-41.;Booth, D.J. 1995, 'Juvenile groups in a coral-reef damselfish: Density-dependent effects on individual fitness and population demography', Ecology, vol. 76, no. 1, pp. 91-106.;Booth, D.J. & Brosnan, D.M. 1995, 'The role of recruitment dynamics in rocky shore and coral reef fish communities', Advances in Ecological Research, vol. 26, pp. 309-385.;Booth, D.J. & Beretta, G.A. 1994, 'Seasonal recruitment, habitat associations and survival of pomacentrid reef fish in the US Virgin Islands', Coral Reefs, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 81-89.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Patterns of distribution and abundance of coral reef fish depend in part on recruitment of a pelagic larval stage, on subsequent dispersal among habitats, and survival of new recruits. We studied recruitment of five species of Stegastes and two species of Chromis damselfish onto reef habitats of St. Thomas, USVI during one year. The two study sites, Flat Cay and Outer Brass Island, were on the southern and northern sides of St. Thomas, respectively. At both sites, recruitment occurred largely in the summer months, although one species (Stegastes planifrons) showed significant winter recruitment at Flat Cay. The onset of increased summer recruitment in 1992 of other species occurred several weeks later and was shorter in duration at Outer Brass Island than at Flat Cay, perhaps indicating differences in oceanographic conditions (currents etc.) or spawning cycles between sites. The two Chromis species showed lunar periodicity of settlement at Flat Cay. At Flat Cay, recruits of three species (S. leucostictus, S. diencaeus and S. planifrons) were associated with conspecifics possibly due to preferential settlement. Similarly, new recruits were more often found near live coral than coral rubble, and very few occurred on sand habitat. Substratum complexity was a poor predictor of recruitment within a habitat, although larger juveniles of some species were more common on more complex substrate. Contrary to other studies, there were no apparent depth preferences among recruits, although larger juveniles of two Stegastes species were found more often in deeper water. It appears that within habitats, newly arriving larvae may be attracted first to the presence of conspecifics and secondarily take up position adjacent to live coral. Apparent survivorship of some Stegastes species and one Chromis species was higher at Outer Brass Island than at Flat Cay, and may partly compensate for lower recruitment of some species at Outer Brass Island. &&copy;1994 Springer-Verlag.;Booth, D.J. 1992, 'Larval settlement patterns and preferences by domino damselfish Dascyllus albisella Gill', Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, vol. 155, no. 1, pp. 85-104.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;In open populations, larval settlement dynamics may be an important determinant of subsequent distribution and abundance of juveniles and adults. A correlative and experimental study of larval settlement in the domino damselfish Dascyllus albisella Gill onto coral reefs off Oahu, Hawaii, was conducted by considering settlement patterns and the extent of larval habitat choice. Conspecific groups live in transient groups on small, branching coral heads and do not interact with adults. By repeatedly censusing a natural patch reef over two summers, and employing a multifactorial experiment on a grid of isolated coral heads, I identified conspecific juvenile density as a major factor influencing settlement. A series of field and laboratory binary choice experiments confirmed that larvae preferred to settle with larger groups of conspecific juveniles than with single conspecifics, emty coral heads or confamilial groups. The laboratory experiment also indicated that preferences may have been established through visual cues, suggesting that vision may supplement chemical cues in facilitating larval settlement preferences. On a larger spatial scale, patterns of settlement at five sites coverig 25 km of Oahu's coastline suggested that two distinct peaks of larval settlement occurred in the summer of 1989 and that settlement was synchronous among these sites. It appears that settlement patterns of a small (within-reef) scale are influenced by larval habitat preferences, while settlement on a larger scale (several reefs) may be synchronized as a result of oceanographic factors or spawning patterns. &&copy;1992.;Booth, D.J. 1991, 'The effects of sampling frequency on estimates of recruitment of the domino damselfish Dascyllus albisella Gill', Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, vol. 145, no. 2, pp. 149-159.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Sampling frequency and methods can potentially affect estimates of demographic rates in population studies. To determine the effects of various sampling protocols on estimating recruitment rate, the rate of larval settlement by the coral reef damselfish Dascyllus albisella Gill to an experimental grid of coral heads was monitored over several intervals by either removing newly settled larvae (recruits) at each census, or not. By sampling every 5 h during two 24-h periods, it was found that most recruits (75% on Day 1 and 81% on Day 2) settled between dusk and dawn. Coral heads that already supported conspecific juvenile groups attracted more recruits than empty coral heads during both 24-h periods, although this was statistically significant on Day 2 only. Subsequent tagging of recruits from 1 to 19 days after settlement revealed that movement between coral heads was negligible after the 1st day postsettlement, but apparent mortality was high over the same period. The settlement rate of larvae to the coral grid during a 19-day period was estimated by employing three protocols of census frequency and recruit removal. This suggested that frequent sampling with recruit removal would most closely estimate true settlement rate for D. albisella and probably other species, while less frequent censuses without recruit removal may provide closer estimates of the size of the recruit cohort that will enter the juvenile population. Considerable variation exists in the sampling protocols used by researchers studying settlement rate in damselfishes and I caution against directly comparing results among these studies. &&copy;1991.;Booth, D.J. 1990, 'Effect of water temperature on stomach evacuation rates, and estimation of daily food intake of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque)', Canadian Journal of Zoology, vol. 68, no. 3, pp. 591-595.;Field experiments were conducted to determine food-evacuation rate and measure stomach fullness.

    "Expertise": "Michael Cortie’s research is directed at the use of metals in nanoscale technology and in nanomaterials in general. Oxidation and other surface phenomena become an important issue at the nanoscale. One solution to these problems is to use noble elements such as gold or silver for nanodevices that need to be metallic, and in this way control the surface properties. In addition, the use of these elements opens up the possibility of exploiting novel optical functionalities, in particular plasmon resonances, and the study of these resonances is a second important theme in Mike’s research. A recent paper, for example, shows how 'dark mode ' plasmon resonances can be excited using a specially tuned nano-antenna. Overall, the work is aimed at the synthesis and/or fabrication of various nanoscale devices, and their eventual exploitation for various technological purposes. One use might be in spectrally selective coatings for energy efficiency, another is in the design of nanoporous sponges for sensor applications.;See some of Cortie's YouTube videos for animations of the nanoscale electric field of of localized surface plasmon resonances;Interesting multimodal plasmon resonance;Longitudinal plasmon resonance;Another theme of Cortie's research is the application of nanotechnology in medicine. In work with colleagues he has shown how gold nanoparticles can be selectively targeted to macrophage cells, for example. Other work has shown up the intriguing possibility that gold nanoparticles can be used to down-regulate (suppress) and inflammatory response in a obese mice (and by implication humans).;Mike also has an interest in intermetallic compounds, shape memory alloys, precious metal alloys, especially of gold and platinum, the stainless steels and the semi-conducting metal oxides. Many of the properties of these substances are controlled by phenomena that occur at the nanoscale. For example, while pure gold is relatively soft, its hardness can be greatly increased by reducing its grain size to several tens of nanometers.;An up to date list of Mike's scientific publications may be found on his Google Scholar profile.;Mike's sixteen most recent scientific publications (as of July 2015) are (* indicates MBC was the 'corresponding author');1.* S.

(eds), Gold Science and Applications, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, pp. 13-30.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Although gold is well down on the periodic table, at position 79, it was the first of the metals to be discovered and exploited by humans. This was almost certainly as a result of it possessing four unique attributes: a bright metallic yellow color, excellent resistance to corrosion, considerable malleability, and a high density (19.32 g/cm3). The high corrosion resistance and density facilitated the concentration of native gold nuggets and powders in the beds of streams, while the yellow color and malleability made it very suitable for the production of jewelry or religious artifacts. A few other metallic elements-such as silver, copper, or platinum-possess color and/or corrosion resistance and/or ductility and/or density, but none to the simultaneous degree exhibited by gold.

It is naturally a dynamic project, with the design being modified as new technologies and materials become available.

The optical extinction of these structures peaked at 740 nm, but there was also evidence of additional extinction maxima at 560, 940 and 1110 nm. Numerical simulations of the optical properties revealed that the extinction was due mainly to scattering rather than to absorption In contrast, the extinction in simple single-shell nanocups was strongly absorptive in nature. Multiple plasmon resonances were identified in the double-cup structures, including an interesting quadrupole resonance in which oscillations of the inner and outer shells should operate 180&&deg;out-of-phase. &&copy;2008 IEEE.;Edgar, J.A., Zareie, H.M., Blaber, M., Dowd, A. & Cortie, M.B. 2008, 'Synthesis of hollow gold nanoparticles and rings using silver templates', Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, ICONN 2008, pp. 36-39.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Gold nanoshells have gained attention recently due to their versatile optical properties. In particular, their spectrally selective extinction has been exploited for experimental medical applications, functional coatings and contrast enhancement for analytical techniques. Here we discuss nanoshells and the formation of gold nanorings by the galvanic replacement of Ag nanosphere template particles. Hollow Au/Ag nanoshells can be converted to nanorings upon addition of excess HAuCl4. Nanorings present a distinct particle geometry, with optical properties exhibiting characteristics of both nanorods and nanoshells. &&copy;2008 IEEE.;Gentle, A.R., Maaroof, A.I., Cortie, M.B. & Smith, G.B. 2007, 'Optical and electrical switching in nanostructured coatings of VO 2', Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Vanadium dioxide undergoes a reversible metal-insulator phase transition at about 68&&deg;C. Coatings of this compound are reflective in the infrared above this temperature, and transmissive or absorptive below it, while resistivity changes by several orders of magnitude. We present a convenient method for depositing films with nano-size grains, which are then optically and electrically characterised. Emphasis in this study is the impact of aluminum doping and grain structure. The optical hysteresis is presented and its switching range is not altered at different doping levels but the value of transition temperature Tc does shift. In contrast hysteresis in dc resistance does change with a strong correlation between the fall in resistance in the semiconductor state with doping, the drop in Tc and the electrical properties in the metal state. For grain sizes under about 180 nm the conductivity in the metal phase is not linear in temperature but is thermally activated, with activation energies AE dependent on both grain size G and doping level. Simple mathematical relationships are found connecting?E with G and with carrier density in the semiconductor state.?E ranges in our samples from 0.15 eV in the smallest grain sizes to around 0.06 eV. This anomalous low frequency metal response is linked to excitations that arise in the metal phase associated with transient singlet pairing on neighbouring sites. Such pairing is weakened by doping, and in large grains appears to be present but incoherent.;Bai, H., Berkahn, M.B. & Cortie, M.B. 2007, 'Characterization of nanometer-sized VO2 nanoparticles prepared by an aqueous route', Proceedings of the 31st Annual Condensed Matter and Materials Meeting, Annual Condensed Matter and Materials Meeting, Australian Institute of Physics, Wagga Wagga, Australia, pp. 1-3.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;We describe a convenient aqueous route to prepare VO2, based on the reductive precipitation of vanadium dioxide VO2 from a vanadate solution.

In this regard, the possibilities for thermo- or electrochromic materials such as VO2 and WO3 are already comparatively well-known. Here, however, we explore a new kind of 'smart' coating, based on the active control of a plasmon resonance in nanoparticles. One possible system is based on the modulation of the plasmon resonance of a precious metal nanorod or nanosphere by an active dielectric shell. The active dielectric undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition on increase of temperature which modulates the plasmon resonance of the underlying precious metal nanoparticle, thereby changing the wavelength at which its optical extinction is maximum. In the case of nanorods, the absorption maximum of the longitudinal plasmon is particularly sensitive to the aspect ratio of the nanoparticle and the dielectric properties of the environment, and may be readily tuned across the visible and near-infrared portions of the spectrum. In addition, nanoparticles of certain thermochromic dielectrics, such as VO 2, are expected to have a plasmon resonance of their own which can be switched on or off by control of the temperature. We consider some of the possibilities, using both the discrete dipole approximation and the exact analytical solution due to Mie to calculate the optical properties.;Maaroof, A.I., Gentle, A.R., Cortie, M.B. & Smith, G.B. 2007, 'Nanoporous plasmonic coatings', Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;The electrical and optical properties of mesoporous gold are compared to those of thin porous gold films and a simulated thin film made by randomly distributing voids in gold, until the voids fill 76% of film volume. All layers are electrically conducting but in some cases the critical percolation thresholds are close to zero, so conduction is possible at very high void content. Significant qualitative differences are apparent between the properties of mesoporous gold, and very thin sputtered gold containing voids, in plasmonic responses at optical frequencies and in dc resistance, both as a function of fill factor. The mesoporous films have an effective plasma frequency determined by void fill factor and structure, but do not support surface plasmons. In contrast thin porous gold layers display optical features associated with localized and de-localized surface plasmons. Sputtered porous gold is 2-dimensional and its percolation threshold requires a \"Swiss-cheese\" rather than particle cluster model. Thicker mesoporous layers have critical parameters consistent with very high connectivity, or equivalently large hyper-dimensionality. Our meso-gold samples display various hyper- dimensionalities from 3 to above 10.;Smith, G.B. & Cortie, M.B. 2007, 'Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society of Optical Engineering: Introduction', Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, p. vii.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Gentle, A., Maaroof, A., Smith, G. & Cortie, M. 2006, 'Optical properties and applications to production of plasmonic thin film nanostructures of self-ordered columnar alumina arrays on glass', Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;In this paper we report on new techniques for making self-ordered porous layers of alumina of varying aspect ratios on glass, without the use of lithographic or masking techniques. Use of RF etching in one of the hole forming steps and also when filling the holes with sputtered metal is shown to be advantageous over additional anodisation. These hole arrays have intrinsically interesting optical responses which will be reported, but their main use is for nano-patterning of subsequent deposited layers either as templates or as masks. High resolution images demonstrate the uniformity in nanohole diameter and in the spacing between holes, which can be achieved when care is used in production. While many nanostructured materials can be deposited using these Porous Anodic Alumina (PAA) templates we focus here on filling the vertical cylindrical holes with silver. Etching during hole filling leads to better-controlled structures and more efficient processes. Novel optical data on the resultant conducting columnar rings will be presented. Spectrally much sharper plasmon resonant features are found than those reported for classical and more random silver column and island arrays. The optical properties are analysed from an effective medium perspective using data from spectrophotometry and ellipsometry. Fitting this data gives modelled layer thickness and the vertical profile in close agreement with direct SEM imaging. The effective refractive indices of the silver columnar layer have interesting and potentially useful dispersion characteristics.;Cankurtaran, B., Ford, M.J. & Cortie, M. 2006, 'Local electromagnetic fields surrounding gold nano-cap particles', Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, ICONN, pp. 478-481.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) the local electromagnetic fields surrounding gold nano-cap particles are investigated.

Numerical solutions to Mie theory were used to calculate the absorption efficiency, Q abs, for nanospheres varying in radii between 5 nm and 100 nm in vacuum. We show that, although gold is the most commonly used nanoparticle material, its absorption efficiency at the plasmon resonance is not as strong as materials such as the alkali metals. Of all the materials tried, potassium spheres with a radius of 21 nm have an optimum absorption efficiency of 14.7. In addition we also show that, unlike gold, the wavelength of the plasmon peak in other materials is sensitive to the sphere radius. In potassium the peak position shifts by 100 nm for spheres ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm, the shift is less than 10 nm for gold spheres. &&copy;2006 IEEE.;Hoft, R.C., Ford, M.J. & Cortie, M.B. 2006, 'Effect of dipole moment on current-voltage characteristics of single molecules', Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, ICONN, pp. 395-398.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;We perform empirical calculations of the tunneling current through various small organic molecules sandwiched between gold electrodes by using the Wenzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation.

The current-voltage characteristics of these molecules are compared in the context of existing first principles and experimental results. In this model the surface dipole moment, induced by the adsorbed molecule, can have a significant effect on the current and hence dipole moments may be an important property for prediction of the conductance characteristics of a molecule. &&copy;2006 IEEE.;Cortie, M. & Xu, X. 2006, 'Control of plasmon resonance in coatings of gold nanorods', Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, ICONN, pp. 470-473.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Gold nanorods manifest a tunable plasmon resonance with light in the visible to near-infrared regions of the spectrum, and have been proposed for use in spectrally selective coatings on glass.

The conductance drops exponentially with increased chain length with decay parameter?n= 0.9. The results are compared with scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on decanedithiol and with other n-alkanedithiol (n = 6,8,10) results in the literature. The theoretical results are found to be an order of magnitude larger than experimental values but follow the same trend. However, two additional, more realistic, geometries are modeled by changing the bond type and by combining the first-principles results with a Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin (WKB) expression for tunneling across the air gap that is invariably present during scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements. These results are more compatible with the experimental data.;Ford, M.J., Kirkup, L., Gentle, A., Zareie, H. & Cortie, M. 2006, 'How reliable are scanning tunneling microscopy measurements of electron transport in molecules?', Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements of tunneling through molecules adsorbed on a surface have been simulated using a standard empirical model based upon the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin method applied to tunneling through a barrier. The Gaussian noise inherent in these experiments has been added to the model data using a Monte Carlo technique. By generating multiple sets of current-voltage curves and fitting these to the model we have evaluated how reliably barrier height can be determined as a function of noise level. The results suggest that for constant percentage standard deviation in the noise greater than 5% the barrier height cannot be determined reliably. At this level, the standard deviation in the estimate of the barrier height is about 10%. Weighted fits give more reliable estimates of the barrier height. If the height of the tip above the molecule is known, so that the fit is only a single parameter the barrier height can be determined reliably even at percentage noise levels as high as 20%. However, in this case unweighted fits must be used otherwise the estimated value deviates by up to 15% from the true value. Data with constant absolute noise give similar results. The effects of experimental resolution have been evaluated in a similar manner and are shown to have a significant influence on the reliability. At a resolution of about 0.1% of full scale the standard deviation in the estimate of barrier height is only about 2% but increases rapidly to 10% for a resolution of about 1%.;Hoft, R.C., Ford, M.J., Cortie, M.B. & IEEE 2006, 'Effect of dipole moment on current-voltage characteristics of single molecules', 2006 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY, VOLS 1 AND 2, pp. 77-80.;Blaber, M.G., Harris, N., Ford, M.J., Cortie, M.B. & IEEE 2006, 'Optimisation of absorption efficiency for varying dielectric spherical nanoparticles', 2006 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY, VOLS 1 AND 2, pp. 61-64.;Cankurtaran, B., Ford, M.J., Cortie, M. & IEEE 2006, 'Local electromagnetic fields surrounding gold nano-cap particles', 2006 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY, VOLS 1 AND 2, pp. 15-18.;Smith, G.B., Maaroof, A., Dowd, A., Gentle, A. & Cortie, M. 2006, 'Tuning plasma frequency for improved solar control glazing using mesoporous nanostructures', Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;The role of the plasma frequency?p of conductors in their use for various solar energy and energy efficiency tasks, especially in transparent solar control window coatings, is analysed for a range of materials including noble and other metals, transparent compound conductors and the metallic phase of VO2. Ways of adjusting?P for improved functionality are considered, including novel mesoporous metals and composites that can have an \"apparent\" or effective plasma frequency. While high?p is needed for high thermal infra-red (IR) reflectance and strong surface plasmon resonant absorption, it is not the only requirement. The location of inter-band terms relative to?p and the solar infra-red, effective bandwidth, and a high relaxation frequency can each alter these responses substantially. Two materials with elevated carrier relaxation rates, in one case when intrinsic, and in another due to mesostructure, are used to demonstrate this impact.

SAMs of two rather different molecules,?,?-p-xylyldithiol ('XYL') and dodecanedithiol ('C12') were produced on a gold {111} substrate, and characterized with respect to their conductivity. The data were fitted with a double tunnel barrier model, in which the two SAMs are primarily differentiated by barrier height and thickness with that of XYL having a thickness of 1.0 nm and a barrier height of 0.78 eV compared to 1.69 nm and 1.39 eV for C12. The remaining parameters of the model were determined by Monte Carlo optimization. Assuming perfect connection of top and bottom electrodes, the leakage current through the XYL at 1 volt is calculated to be 1.4105 A/cm2, compared to 2.7104 A/cm2 through C12. These values are not as low as can be obtained with SiO2 of the same thickness.

The proportions of light that are absorbed and scattered vary with wavelength. Any light that is absorbed will cause heating of the particles, and this effect may potentially be exploited for solar glazing coatings, nanoscale lithography or medical treatments. The position of maximum absorption of an isolated spherical nanoparticle is 518 nm, but this may be significantly red-shifted by means of decreasing the symmetry to an prolate spheroid or 'nanorod', or by producing a metal 'nanoshell' on a dielectric core, or by aggregating insulated spherical particles. Absorption peaks in the vicinity of 655 nm for aggregated particles and 780 nm for prolate spheroids are demonstrated here. Absorbed energy is released as heat into the environment of the particles, and will cause a temperature rise within the particle the magnitude of which depends upon the value of the effective heat transfer coefficient between particle and environment. The latter is not known, but we show how highly localized temperature rises of some tens of Celsius might be conceivable in systems illuminated by sunlight.;Smith, G., Cortie, M.B. & Maaroof, A.I. 2005, 'The apparent optical indices of spongy nanoporous gold', Proceedings of the 16th National Congress of the Australian Institute of Physics, National Congress of the AIP, Australian Institute of Physics, Canberra, pp. 177-180.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Very thin spongy nanoporous gold films have a unique nanostructure and hence unusual properties. Our interest in these materials is also due to their wide range of potential application (1,2). An optical study for such nanostructured films is of fundamental interest for understanding how light interacts with such a spongy nanoporous structure. In general the gold either percolates or is very closely packed. This surface plasmons, and surface plasmon resonant effects, are expected to play a key role given the large surface area of metal and the metal backbone of the nanostructure. The ropological complexity of the nano-void network is also expected to be a major influence. The optical response has, for a metal system, quite unusual dispersion relations for the effective complex refractive index components n*, k*.

Virtual bound states for resonant photons result, with the associated transit delay leading to a large rise in n* in many nanostructures.

A method for rapidly predicting the formation and stability of undiscovered single phase high-entropy alloys (SPHEAs) is provided. Our software implementation of the algorithm uses data for 73 metallic elements and rapidly combines them - 4, 5 or 6 elements at a time - using the Miedema semi-empirical methodology to yield estimates of formation enthalpy. Approximately 186,000,000 compositions of 4, 5 and 6 element alloys were screened, and?1900 new equimolar SPHEAs predicted. Of the 185 experimentally reported HEA systems currently known, the model correctly predicted the stability of the SPHEA structure in 177. The other sixteen are suggested to actually form a partially ordered solid solution - a finding supported by other recent experimental and theoretical work. The stability of each alloy at a specific temperature can also be predicted, allowing precipitation temperatures (and the likely precipitate) to be forecast. This combinatorial algorithm is described in detail, and its software implementation is freely accessible through a web-service allowing rapid advances in the design, development and discovery of new technologically important alloys.;Chen, Y., Zeng, D., Cortie, M.B., Dowd, A., Guo, H., Wang, J. & Peng, D.L. 2015, 'Seed-induced growth of flower-like Au-Ni-ZnO metal-semiconductor hybrid nanocrystals for photocatalytic applications', Small, vol. 11, no. 12, pp. 1460-1469.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. The combination of metal and semiconductor components in nanoscale to form a hybrid nanocrystal provides an important approach for achieving advanced functional materials with special optical, magnetic and photocatalytic functionalities. Here, a facile solution method is reported for the synthesis of Au-Ni-ZnO metal-semiconductor hybrid nanocrystals with a flower-like morphology and multifunctional properties. This synthetic strategy uses noble and magnetic metal Au@Ni nanocrystal seeds formed in situ to induce the heteroepitaxial growth of semiconducting ZnO nanopyramids onto the surface of metal cores. Evidence of epitaxial growth of ZnO{0001} facets on Ni {111} facets is observed on the heterojunction, even though there is a large lattice mismatch between the semiconducting and magnetic components. Adjustment of the amount of Au and Ni precursors can control the size and composition of the metal core, and consequently modify the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and magnetic properties. Room-temperature superparamagnetic properties can be achieved by tuning the size of Ni core. The as-prepared Au-Ni-ZnO nanocrystals are strongly photocatalytic and can be separated and re-cycled by virtue of their magnetic properties. The simultaneous combination of plasmonic, semiconducting and magnetic components within a single hybrid nanocrystal furnishes it multifunctionalities that may find wide potential applications. Au-Ni-ZnO ternary metal-semiconductor hybrid nanocrystals are synthesized using a method that utilizes Au@Ni seeds formed in situ to induce the epitaxial growth of ZnO {0001} facets on Ni {111} facets. Excellent photocatalytic properties along with magnetic recycling ability are achieved. The prepared nanocrystals possess plasmonic, semiconducting, and magnetic functionalities and are expected to find wide application in multiple technological fields.;King, D.J.M., Middleburgh, S.C., Liu, A.C.Y., Tahini, H.A., Lumpkin, G.R. & Cortie, M.B. 2015, 'Formation and structure of V-Zr amorphous alloy thin films', Acta Materialia, vol. 83, pp. 269-275.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of Acta Materialia Inc. All rights reserved. Although the equilibrium phase diagram predicts that alloys in the central part of the V-Zr system should consist of V2Zr Laves phase with partial segregation of one element, it is known that under non-equilibrium conditions these materials can form amorphous structures. Here we examine the structures and stabilities of thin film V-Zr alloys deposited at room temperature by magnetron sputtering. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and computational methods. Atomic-scale modelling was used to investigate the enthalpies of formation of the various competing structures. The calculations confirmed that an amorphous solid solution would be significantly more stable than a random body-centred solid solution of the elements, in agreement with the experimental results. In addition, the modelling effort provided insight into the probable atomic configurations of the amorphous structures allowing predictions of the average distance to the first and second nearest neighbours in the system.;Zhu, S., Cheng, H.H., Blakey, I., Stokes, N., Ostrikov, K. & Cortie, M. 2015, 'Plasmonic 'top-hat' nano-star arrays by electron beam lithography', Microelectronic Engineering, vol. 139, pp. 13-18.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.. Lithography techniques play an important role in the fabrication of nanoscale functional devices. In electron beam lithography (EBL) the optimum dose of electron irradiation is a critical parameter. In this paper, we first identify suitable EBL fabrication parameters by writing patterns with different sizes, periods and electron radiation doses. After finding suitable fabrication parameters, we show how five-pointed gold nanostructures with electric field-enhancing 'top hats' can be fabricated using EBL. Reflectance data of these arrays is measured in order to assess their potential applications in biosensing arrays;De Silva, K.S.B., Gentle, A., Arnold, M., Keast, V.J. & Cortie, M.B. 2015, 'Dielectric function and its predicted effect on localized plasmon resonances of equiatomic Au-Cu', Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, vol. 48, no. 21.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 IOP Publishing Ltd. Equiatomic (Au,Cu) solid solution orders below 658 K to form a tetragonal AuCu (I) phase with significant changes in physical properties and the crystal structure. The effect of ordering on the dielectric function of the material is controversial however, with inconsistent results reported in the literature. Since the nature of any localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the nanostructures is very sensitive to the dielectric function, this uncertainty hinders the use of AuCu in plasmonic devices or structures. Therefore, we re-examine the question using a combination of measurements and computations. We find that no significant change in the dielectric function occurs when this material becomes ordered, at least over the range of photon energies relevant to LSPRs. The likely properties of LSPRs in plasmonic devices made of AuCu are analyzed. Use of the alloy offers some advantages over pure Cu, however pure Au would still be the superior option in most situations.;King, D.M., Middleburgh, S.C., Edwards, L., Lumpkin, G.R. & Cortie, M. 2015, 'Predicting the Crystal Structure and Phase Transitions in High-Entropy Alloys', JOM, vol. 67, no. 10, pp. 2375-2380.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Australia. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have advantageous properties compared with other systems as a result of their chemistry and crystal structure. The transition between a face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC) structure in the Alinfx/infCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy system has been investigated on the atomic scale in this work. The Alinfx/infCoCrFeNi system, as well as being a useful system itself, can also be considered a model HEA material. Ordering in the FCC structure was investigated, and an order;8211#disorder transition was predicted at ~600&&nbsp;K. It was found that, at low temperatures, an ordered lattice is favored over a truly random lattice. The fully disordered BCC structure was found to be unstable. When partial ordering was imposed (lowering the symmetry), with Al and Ni limited specific sites of the BCC system, the BCC packing was stabilized. Decomposition of the ordered BCC single phase into a dual phase (Al-Ni rich and Fe-Cr rich) is also considered.;Keast, V.J., Ewald, J., De Silva, K.S.B., Cortie, M.B., Monnier, B., Cuskelly, D. & Kisi, E.H. 2015, 'Optical properties and electronic structure of the Cu-Zn brasses', Journal of Alloys and Compounds, vol. 647, pp. 129-135.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 Elsevier B.V. The color of Cu-Zn brasses range from the red of copper through bright yellow to grey-silver as the Zn content increases. Here we examine the mechanism by which these color changes occur. The optical properties of this set of alloys has been calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and compared to experimental spectroscopy measurements. The optical response of the low Zn content?-brasses is shown to have a distinctly different origin to that in the higher content??,? and?-brasses. The response of??-brass is unique in that it is strongly influenced by an overdamped plasmon excitation and this alloy will also have a strong surface plasmon response.;Fletcher, G., Arnold, M.D., Pedersen, T., Keast, V.J. & Cortie, M.B. 2015, 'Multipolar and dark-mode plasmon resonances on drilled silver nano-triangles', Optics Express, vol. 23, no. 14, pp. 18002-18002.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Tai, M.C., Gentle, A., de Silva, K.S.B., Arnold, M.D., van der Lingen, E. & Cortie, M.B. 2015, 'Thermal stability of nanoporous raney gold catalyst', Metals, vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 1197-1211.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 by the authors, licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Nanoporous 'Raney gold' sponge was prepared by de-alloying an Au-Al precursor alloy. Catalytic tests using a micro-reactor confirmed that Raney gold can serve as an active heterogeneous catalyst for CO oxidation, reduction of NO to Ninf2/inf, and oxidation of NO to NOinf2/inf. In general, the specific surface area of a heterogeneous catalyst has an influence on its catalytic efficacy. Unfortunately, gold sponges coarsen readily, leading to sintering of their structure and reduction in surface area. This potentially places constraints on their upper operating temperature in catalytic reactors. Here we analyzed the behavior of Raney gold when the temperature was raised. We examined the kinetics and mechanism of coarsening of the sponge using a combination of in situoptical measurements and Metropolis Monte Carlo modeling with a Lennard-Jones interatomic potential. Modeling showed that the sponges started with an isotropic 'foamy' morphology with negative average 'mean curvature' but that subsequent thermally activated coarsening will drive the morphology through a bi-continuous fibrous state and on, eventually, to a sponge consisting of sintered blobs of predominantly positive 'mean curvature'.;Supansomboon, S., Dowd, A., Gentle, A., Van Der Lingen, E. & Cortie, M.B. 2015, 'Thin films of PtAl2 and AuAl2 by solid-state reactive synthesis', Thin Solid Films, vol. 589, pp. 805-812.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 Elsevier B.V. The intermetallic compounds AuAlinf2/inf and PtAlinf2/inf are colored purple and yellow respectively. In the past they have been prepared by bulk melting techniques or by co-deposition in a magnetron sputterer. Here, however, we investigate films of AuAlinf2/inf, PtAlinf2/inf and (Au,Pt)Alinf2/inf prepared by sequential physical vapor deposition of the elements, followed by in situ solid-state reaction. The microstructure, dielectric functions, optical properties and thermal stability of the resulting films are characterized and compared to those prepared by bulk melting or co-deposition. The (Au,Pt)Alinf2/inf films show a color gamut that stretches from purple to brassy yellow depending on composition and microstructure. High temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments show that the (Au,Pt)Alinf2/inf phase is metastable, decomposing when heated above 420 &&deg;C. In contrast, the pure AuAlinf2/inf or PtAlinf2/inf phases are stable to about 580 &&deg;C before they oxidize or decompose. The alternative possibility of producing the purple-to-yellow color gamut by depositing optical stacks of very thin films of AuAlinf2/inf and PtAlinf2/inf is also assessed. Either scheme will provide a range of colors lying between those of the binary compound endpoints. Calculations predict that deposition of AuAlinf2/inf onto PtAlinf2/inf will produce more intense colors than vice versa, an unexpected finding that is worth further investigation.;Keast, V.J., Walhout, C.J., Pedersen, T., Shahcheraghi, N., Cortie, M.B. & Mitchell, D.R.G. 2015, 'Higher Order Plasmonic Modes Excited in Ag Triangular Nanoplates by an Electron Beam', Plasmonics, pp. 1-6.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York Ag triangular nanoplates are known to generate strong plasmonic resonances when excited by both light and electron beams. Experimental electron energy-loss spectra (EELS) and maps were acquired using an aberration-corrected JEOL-ARM microscope. The corner, edge and centre modes that are often observed in such structures were also observed in these measurements. In addition, novel higher order internal modes were observed and were found to be well reproduced by theoretical calculations using boundary element method (BEM). These modes are 'dark modes' so are not observed in the optical extinction spectra. They are confined surface propagating modes and are analogous to laser cavity modes.;Keast, V.J., Wallace, J.W., Wrightson, C.J., Tai, M., Gentle, A., Arnold, M.D. & Cortie, M.B. 2015, 'The effect of vacancies on the optical properties of AuAl2', Journal of Physics Condensed Matter, vol. 27, no. 50.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 IOP Publishing Ltd. AuAl2 is an intermetallic compound with a vivid purple colour attributable to a bulk plasmon energy in the visible part of the spectrum. However, the colour of as-deposited thin films is not as strong and only develops upon annealing. Density functional theory calculations of the dielectric function are presented for a variety of vacancy types and concentrations. The results support the view that the effect of annealing on colour is correlated with a reduction in concentration of Al vacancies. The effect of vacancies on the optical properties can be understood as arising from the complex interplay between interband transitions around the Fermi level and the plasmon energy.;Coutts, M.J., Zareie, H.M., Cortie, M.B. & McDonagh, A.M. 2014, 'Charging of gold/metal oxide/gold nanocapacitors in a scanning electron microscope', Nanotechnology, vol. 25, no. 15.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Triangular parallel-plate nanocapacitors were fabricated by a combination of microsphere lithography and physical vapor deposition. The devices were comprised of a 20 nm layer of dielectric material sandwiched between two 20 nm layers of gold. Dielectric materials with a range of relative permittivities were investigated. Charging of the capacitors was probed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) by monitoring the change in brightness of the images of the devices as a function of time. The time constants, RC, associated with the charging of the capacitors, were extracted from the SEM grayscale data. The resulting average RC values were 248 &&plusmn;27 s for SiO2, 70 &&plusmn;8 s for Al2O3, 113 &&plusmn;80 s for ZnO and 125 &&plusmn;13 s for HfO2.

The typical Cu nanospheres are single crystals with a size of 23.4 &&plusmn;1.5 nm, and can self-assemble into three-dimensional (3D) nanocrystal superlattices with a large scale. By manipulating the chemical additives, monodisperse Cu nanocubes with tailorable sizes have also been obtained. The probable formation mechanism of these Cu nanocrystals is discussed. The narrow size distribution results in strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks even though the resonance is located in the interband transition region. Double SPR peaks are observed in the extinction spectra for the Cu nanocubes with relative large sizes. Theoretical simulation of the extinction spectra indicates that the SPR band located at longer wavelengths is caused by assembly of Cu nanocubes into more complex structures. The synthesis procedure that we report here is expected to foster systematic investigations on the physical properties and self-assembly of Cu nanocrystals with shape and size singularity for their potential applications in photonic and nanoelectronic devices. &&copy;2014 American Chemical Society.;Dowd, A., Pissuwan, D. & Cortie, M.B. 2014, 'Optical readout of the intracellular environment using nanoparticle transducers', Trends in Biotechnology, vol. 32, no. 11, pp. 571-577.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. There is rapid growth in the use of multi-functional nanoparticles as transducers to probe the intracellular environment. New designs of nanoparticles can provide quantitative information at sub-cellular resolution on parameters such as pH, temperature and concentration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or selected metal ions. This new work builds on the existing practice of using nanoparticles and fluorescent dyes to provide enhanced microscopic images of cells, but goes beyond it by adding new functionalities and analytical capabilities. In this review, we discuss the recent literature on the development of such nanoparticles for simultaneous biosensing and imaging. We explore and examine the different measurements that will be possible, and analyze the likely accuracy and resolution that could be achieved.;Supansomboon, S., Porkovich, A., Dowd, A., Arnold, M.D. & Cortie, M.B. 2014, 'Effect of precursor stoichiometry on the morphology of nanoporous platinum sponges', ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, vol. 6, no. 12, pp. 9411-9417.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Nanoscale sponges formed by de-alloying suitable metallic alloys have a wide variety of potential applications due to their enhanced catalytic, optical, and electrochemical properties. In general, these materials have a bi-continuous, vermicular morphology of pores and ligaments with a fibrous appearance, however, other morphologies are sometimes reported. Here, we investigate how stoichiometry and process parameters control the characteristics of sponges formed from thin film precursors of AlxPt. Materials deposited at elevated temperatures and with mole fraction of Al between 0.65 and 0.90 produce the classic isotropic fibrous sponges with a morphology that varies systematically with precursor stoichiometry, however, de-alloying of material deposited at room temperature produced unusual isotropic foamy sponges. The evidence suggests that formation of a conventional fibrous sponge requires an equilibrated precursor whereas foamy morphologies will result if the precursor is metastable. Modeling was used to investigate the range of possible morphologies. As stoichiometry changed in the model system, the average mean and Gaussian curvature of the sponges systematically changed, too. The evolution of these shapes passed through certain special morphologies, for example, modelled structures with 0.80 Al had a zero average Gaussian curvature and might represent a structural optimum for some applications. These observations provide a means to control sponge morphology at the nanoscale. &&copy;2014 American Chemical Society.;Elcombe, M.M., Kealley, C.S., Bhatia, V.K., Thorogood, G.J., Carter, D.J., Avdeev, M. & Cortie, M.B. 2014, 'Determination of martensite structures of the Au7Cu 5Al4 and Au7Cu5.7Al3.3 shape-memory alloys', Acta Materialia, vol. 79, pp. 234-240.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The?-phase of Au7Cu5Al4 undergoes a reversible shape-memory phase transformation for which several conflicting martensite phases have been reported.

Replacement of expensive Pt-based catalysts with earth-abundant catalysts is beneficial for this field. In this study, nanoscale magnetic metal phosphides including Co2P, Co1.33Ni0.67P and Ni2P nanorods are synthesized by a facile solution method. Their HER activities and stabilities on glassy carbon and Ti electrodes are investigated. The Co2P nanorods deposited on glassy carbon electrodes are found to show higher activity and better reversibility than the Co1.33Ni0.67P and Ni2P counterparts. Nevertheless, the Co1.33Ni0.67P and Ni2P samples on Ti electrodes gain a significant activity promotion after annealing in H2/Ar atmosphere. Investigation of the Tafel curves shows that the Co2P nanorods on glassy carbon have the lowest Tafel slope while their exchange current density on Ti electrode exhibits a high value which is comparable to that of Pt electrode. Furthermore, the cyclic voltammetric tests show that the reversibility of annealed Co2P on Ti electrode is the best, which emphasizes the superiority of Co species in catalyzing HER reaction. Finally, the three magnetic metal phosphide catalysts are found to exhibit good stabilities in acidic conditions according to the galvanostatic testing results.;Moezzi, A., Cortie, M., Dowd, A. & McDonagh, A. 2014, 'On the formation of nanocrystalline active zinc oxide from zinc hydroxide carbonate', Journal of Nanoparticle Research, vol. 16, no. 4.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The decomposition of zinc hydroxide carbonate, Zn5(CO 3)2(OH)6 (ZHC), into the high surface area form of ZnO known as \"active zinc oxide\" is examined.

Here we use a combination of calculation and sample manufacture to assess two strategies by which thin films of these elements can be produced with a controlled range of far-field optical properties. In the first approach, control can be achieved by manipulating the density of states of metastable solid solutions, which in turn controls the dielectric function. In the second approach the optical properties of the films are controlled by varying the geometry of stacks fabricated from the constituent elements. We show that the two approaches can produce equivalent results so both are viable options in practice.

In order to evaluate potential alternatives to pure Au, the density of states (DOS), dielectric function and plasmon quality factor have been calculated for alloys and compounds of Au with Al, Cd, Mg, Pd, Pt, Sn, Ti, Zn and Zr.

At room temperature the sample is comprised of randomly close-packed gold nanoparticles of about 2.3 nm diameter with a ligand shell of about 0.2 nm effective thickness. As the particles are heated through 80 C they begin to coarsen, reaching about 10 nm diameter at 180 C. Upon further heating, rapid sintering and grain growth occurs at a temperature that depends on environment and heating rate. Sintering in vacuum requires a higher temperature than in oxidizing environments. Mass spectrometry in the former case is consistent with volatile species such as C 4H9, C2SH, and C2H4 being displaced, whereas XPS shows that the exposed surface of the Au is rich in C and S. However, when sintering is performed in the presence of even trace O 2, it is the Au-S bond that is cleaved, and the sintering temperature is lowered by up to 50 C. In this case mass spectrometry shows the generation of alkane and thiol fragments, some S2 and H2S, and oxidized sulfur-containing species, whereas XPS shows that C and S on the Au surface is much reduced. &&copy;2013 American Chemical Society.;Frederiksen, M., Bochenkov, V.E., Cortie, M.B. & Sutherland, D.S. 2013, 'Plasmon hybridization and field confinement in multilayer metal-dielectric nanocups', Journal of Physical Chemistry C, vol. 117, no. 30, pp. 15782-15789.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Large-area arrays of dispersed multilayer gold-dielectric nanocups were fabricated by colloidal lithography and studied by extinction spectroscopy.

However, the short-term impact of such AuNPs on physiological systems, in particular resident macrophages located in fat tissue in vivo, is largely unknown. This project investigated the distribution, organ toxicity and changes in inflammatory cytokines within the adipose tissue after mice were exposed to AuNPs. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with a single dose of AuNPs (7.85?g AuNPs/g). Body weight and energy intake were recorded daily. Tissues were collected at 1 h, 24 h and 72 h post-injection to test for organ toxicity. AuNP distribution was examined using electron microscopy. Proinflammatory cytokine expression and macrophage number within the abdominal fat pad were determined using real-time PCR. Results: At 72 hours post AuNP injection, daily energy intake and body weight were found to be similar between Control and AuNP treated mice. However, fat mass was significantly smaller in AuNP-treated mice. Following IP injection, AuNPs rapidly accumulated within the abdominal fat tissue and some were seen in the liver. A reduction in TNF? and IL-6 mRNA levels in the fat were observed from 1 h to 72 h post AuNP injection, with no observable changes in macrophage number. There was no detectable toxicity to vital organs (liver and kidney). Conclusion: Our 21 nm spherical AuNPs caused no measurable organ or cell toxicity in mice, but were correlated with significant fat loss and inhibition of inflammatory effects. With the growing incidence of obesity and obesity-related diseases, our findings offer a new avenue for the potential development of gold nanoparticles as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of such disorders. &&copy;2013 Chen et al.;Moezzi, A., Cortie, M. & McDonagh, A.M. 2013, 'Formation of zinc hydroxide nitrate by H+-catalyzed dissolution-precipitation', European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry, no. 8, pp. 1326-1335.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The formation of zinc hydroxide nitrate, Zn5(OH) 8(NO3)22H2O, by reaction between zinc oxide and aqueous zinc nitrate solution was examined.

The rate of the reaction displayed sigmoidal behavior with the maximum conversion rate at ca. 75 min. The reaction stoichiometry involves a 1:1 ZnO/Zn(NO3)2 molar ratio. The data indicate that an amorphous zinc-containing intermediate phase is formed during the transition, and that the zinc hydroxide nitrate crystals nucleate and grow from this phase. The crystals of zinc hydroxide nitrate are several?m in size, but are formed from zinc oxide crystals of only a few hundred nanometers in size, indicating that mass transfer in the aqueous phase plays an important role. We propose that H+-catalyzed dissolution/precipitation is the key process in the mechanism of the reaction. The zinc hydroxide nitrate is stable to about 110&&deg;C, but decomposes above that temperature to a series of less hydrated phases, with associated loss of mass, until zinc oxide is formed at about 190&&deg;C. The solubility product, Ksp, of Zn 5(OH)8(NO3)22H2O in water was measured by two independent techniques and found to be in the range of 7.4-8.5 10-11.

From these, the reflectivity, electron energy-loss spectra (EELS) and small sphere extinction spectra are predicted. The experimental reflectivity and EELS were measured for PtAl2 and showed good agreement with the theoretical spectra. The yellow color of PtAl2 is associated with a bulk plasmon at 3 eV. We predict that the optical properties of hypothetical intermediate alloys would show a smooth evolution with composition. The details of this change can be understood by examination of the underlying density of states (DOS). The predicted small sphere extinction spectra and quality factors show a strong surface plasmon resonance for these materials, with PtAl2 having the optimum performance.

The process is driven by dehydration of the starting salt. Dehydration of Zn5(OH)8(CH3CO2) 22H2O also occurs when it is heated in air, but the product obtained in that case depends on the heating rate, environment and temperature. For example, when it is kept in a sealed silica capillary at 100 &&deg;C, Zn5(OH)8(CH3CO2) 21.5H2O is formed after 15 min, whereas treatment in the range 90-100&&deg;C in an open environment results in the formation of anhydrous zinc hydroxide acetate. Heating of any of these products further causes their decomposition to Zn(CH3CO2)2 and ZnO. The coordination bonding mode of the acetate groups in the anhydrous layered zinc hydroxide acetate prepared by reaction with ethanol was studied by using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The presence of chelating, unidentate and bidentate bridging modes for the carbonyl carbon atom was revealed, but there was no evidence for the inclusion of ethanol in the resultant structure. Therefore, the reaction in ethanol offers a convenient strategy to prepare anhydrous zinc hydroxide acetate and/or zinc oxide, because it avoids the sensitivity of the thermally induced dehydroxlation process to time, temperature and environment. Decomposition of zinc hydroxide acetate dihydrate in ethanol can be exploited to generate ZnO nanoparticles at room temperature. The mechanism involves the removal of waters of hydration and the formation of Zn5(OH)8(CH3CO2)2 followed by the generation of Zn(CH3CO)2 and ZnO. Copyright &&copy;2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Even though they consist entirely of gold or silver atoms, these materials appear black and dull, in great contrast with the familiar luster of continuous gold and silver. The nature of these anomalous optical characteristics is revealed here by combining nanoscale electron energy loss spectroscopy with discrete dipole and boundary element simulations. It is established that the strong broad-band absorption finds its origin in nanoscale splitting of light, with great local variations in the absorbed color. This nanoscale polychromaticity results from the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances, which are imaged and analyzed here with deep sub-wavelength, nanometer spatial resolution. We demonstrate that, with this insight, it is possible to customize the absorbance and reflectance wavelength bands of thin nanoporous films by only tuning their morphology. &&copy;2011 American Chemical Society.;Porkovich, A.J., Arnold, M.D., Kouzmina, G., Hingley, B. & Cortie, M.B. 2012, 'Calorimetric sensor for H 2O 2/H 2O mist streams', IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 12, no. 7, pp. 2392-2398.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Mist streams comprised of H 2O 2/H 2O droplets are a recent innovation for disinfecting medical equipment, but the availability of a sensor that could monitor the concentration of H 2O 2 applied during the treatment would be desirable. Here we describe a means to obtain a rapid estimation of H 2O 2 concentration in this environment. The proposed sensor is based on a platinum resistance thermometer coated with a layer of MnO 2 catalyst. It may be calibrated to operate either during the mist delivery step of a disinfection cycle, or during the evacuation (drying) phase. Cooling of the sensor surface due to evaporation of H 2O} and effervescence of decomposing H 2O 2 operates against heat generated by the decomposition reaction to produce a well-defined minimum in the temperature. The time and temperature at which this minimum occurs are well correlated, with the H 2O 2 content of the solution used to produce the mist droplets. &&copy;2012 IEEE.;Stokes, N., Cortie, M.B., Davis, T.J. & McDonagh, A.M. 2012, 'Plasmon Resonances in V-Shaped Gold Nanostructures', Plasmonics, vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 235-243.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Using numerical simulations, we examine the change in plasmon resonance behavior in gold nanorod structures that have a V shape. The reduction in symmetry compared to linear rods causes two different longitudinal-type resonances to appear in a single structure, and the relative intensity and hybridization of these can be controlled by varying the angle of the arms of the \"V.\" The resonances may also be selectively excited by controlling the polarization of the incident light, thereby providing a convenient way to control a nanoscale optical electric field using far-field parameters. For example, the wavelength at which a strong resonance occurs in the V-shaped structures studied can be switched between 630 and 900 nm by a 90&&deg;rotation of the polarization of the incident light. Due to the symmetry of the targets, there will be three types of special near-field location, a location at which the electric field intensity is enhanced by either resonance, a location at which the electric field intensity is enhanced by the 630 nm resonance but not by the 890 nm resonance, and a location at which the electric field intensity is enhanced by the 890 nm resonance but not by the 630 nm one. &&copy;2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.;Cortie, M.B., Liu, F., Arnold, M.D. & Niidome, Y. 2012, 'Multimode resonances in silver nanocuboids', Langmuir, vol. 28, no. 24, pp. 9103-9112.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;A rich variety of dipolar and higher order plasmon resonances have been predicted for nanoscale cubes and parallopipeds of silver, in contrast to the simple dipolar modes found on silver nanospheres or nanorods. However, in general, these multimode resonances are not readily detected in experimental colloidal ensembles, due primarily to the usual variation of size and shape of the particles obscuring or blending the individual extinction peaks. Recently, methods have been found to prepare silver parallopipeds with unprecedented shape control by nucleating the silver onto a tightly controlled suspension of gold nanorods (Okuno, Y., Nishioka, K., Kiya, A., Nakashima, N., Ishibashi, A., Niidome, Y. Uniform and Controllable Preparation of Au-Ag Core-Shell Nanorods Using Anisotropic Silver Shell Formation on Gold Nanorods. Nanoscale2010, 2, 1489-1493). The optical extinction spectra of suspensions of such monodisperse particles are found to contain multiple extinction peaks, which we show here to be due to the multimode resonances predicted by theoretical studies. Control of the radius of the nanoparticle edges is found to be an effective way to turn some of these modes on or off.

The discovery of the seeded, wet-chemical synthetic process to produce them may be regarded as a landmark in the control of metal nanoparticle shape. However, the mechanism by which the initial spherical gold seeds acquire anisotropy is a critical, yet poorly understood, factor. Here we examine the very early stages of rod growth using a combination of techniques including cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopy, and computational modeling. Reconciliation of the available experimental observations can only be achieved by invoking a stochastic, \"popcorn\"-like mechanism of growth, in which individual seeds lie quiescent for some time before suddenly and rapidly growing into rods. This is quite different from the steady, concurrent growth of nanorods that has been previously generally assumed. Furthermore we propose that the shape is controlled by the ratio of surface energy of rod sides to rod ends, with values of this quantity in the range of 0.3-0.8 indicated for typical growth solutions. &&copy;2012 American Chemical Society.;Moezzi, A., McDonagh, A.M. & Cortie, M.B. 2012, 'Zinc oxide particles: Synthesis, properties and applications', Chemical Engineering Journal, vol. 185-186, pp. 1-22.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Zinc oxide powder has traditionally been used as a white pigment and as an additive to rubber.

Similarly, while some of the low-volume processes used to manufacture ZnO nanostructures have been well covered in the literature, there has been far less reported on the tonnage chemical engineering processes by which most ZnO is actually made. The multiplicity of processes by which ZnO can be produced is a potential source of confusion, however, the process used has a large influence on the properties of the oxide, and hence on its suitability for various applications.

We have used numerical simulations to estimate the effect that the shape of gold nanoparticles would have on the performance on such sensors. A variety of geometries of gold nanoparticles were investigated, including nano-spheres, nano-rods, nano-triangles, and nano-bowties. The performance of a sensor that operates at a single wavelength is controlled by dT/dn, the change in transmittance T with refractive index n, determined at the interrogation wavelength. In turn, dT/dn depends upon the extinction cross-section of the nanoparticles at the chosen wavelength, and on the density of the nanoparticles in the light path. Contributions to the sensor efficiency also include the shift in wavelength of the plasmon resonance and, importantly, the peak sharpness.

Individual VO 2 nanoparticles undergo a localized plasmon resonance with near-infrared light at about 1100 nm and this resonance can be switched on and off by simply varying the temperature of the system. Therefore, incorporation of VO2 nanoparticles into a coating system imbues the coating with the ability to self-adaptively modulate its own absorptive efficiency in the near-infrared.

In our experimental work the Au nanoparticles were grown in situ using a wet chemical electroless plating technique while the Ag nanoparticles were produced by physical vapour deposition. The optical properties were numerically simulated using the discrete dipole approximation. The resulting measured or calculated transmission spectra were mapped to the CIE L-a*-b* colour space. The aspect ratio of the nanoparticles was the primary factor in determining the colours in both cases. However, increasing the nucleation rate of the particles resulted in them becoming more closely packed, which also red-shifted the optical extinction peak of the structure due to interactions of their near-fields. This caused an enhancement in the blue component of the transmitted light.

In particular, they can support a longitudinal surface plasmon, which results in suspensions of them having a strong extinction peak in the upper visible or near-infrared parts of the spectrum. The position of this peak can be readily tuned by controlling the shape of the rods. In addition, the surface of the nanorods can be functionalized by a very wide variety of molecules. This has led to interest in their use as selective biomarkers in biodiagnostics or for selective targeting in photothermal thearapeutics. Here, we review the recent advances in the use of gold nanorods in these applications.

The equilibrium geometries for the radicals adsorbing on the surface are first calculated and the radicals then placed in the junction geometry. The unit cell is stepwise increased in length and the geometry relaxed at each step. When stretching the ethynyl junction, a single gold atom is detached from the rest of the surface and the gold-carbon bond does not break. In contrast, the gold-sulfur bond in the thiyl junction breaks without detaching any gold atoms. This behaviour can be attributed to the enhanced strength of the Au-C interaction over the Au-S interaction. In both junctions the conductance calculated using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF) decreases as the junction is stretched. After breakage of the Au-S bond, the thiyl radical contains an unpaired electron on the sulfur atom and the system is in a spin doublet state. Transmission spectra were calculated for the spin-unpolarized case only, evaluation of the spin-polarized density of states suggests that an enhanced conductance for electrons of one spin type may be observed after the Au-S bond is broken. &&copy;2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.;Zareie, H.M., Morgan, S.W., Moghaddam, M., Maaroof, A.I., Cortie, M.B. & Phillips, M.R. 2008, 'Nanocapacitive circuit elements', ACS Nano, vol. 2, no. 8, pp. 1615-1619.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Natural\" lithography was used to prepare arrays of nanoscale capacitors on silicon.

Here we compare nanoshells and nanorods in terms of their ease of synthesis, their optical properties, and their longer term technological prospects as tunable \"plasmonic absorbers\". While both particle types are now routinely prepared by wet chemistry, we submit that it is more convenient to prepare rods. Furthermore, the plasmon resonance and peak absorption efficiency in nanorods may be readily tuned into the infrared by an increase of their aspect ratio, whereas in nanoshells such tuning may require a decrease in shell thickness to problematic dimensions.;Supansomboona, S., Maaroof, A. & Cortie, M.B. 2008, '\"Purple glory\": The optical properties and technology of AuAl2 coatings', Gold Bulletin, vol. 41, no. 4, pp. 296-304.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;The application of thin coatings of the purple gold intermetallic compound AuAl2 provides a possible alternative to the use of this material in the bulk form.

Control of the thickness and microstructure of the deposit allowed the optical properties of the film to be tuned over a wide range. The properties were characterised using CIE LAB colour coordinates, and by measurement and calculation of reflection and transmission spectra. Reflection colours could be varied at will between dark-silver through to light purple, and were largely a function of the degree of crystallization of the deposit. Transmission colours could be varied from light to dark greenish-brown, and were a function of both microstructure and film thickness.

Samples of nanoporous gold of various morphologies are analyzed with a combination of electrical and optical data. Growing thin films and complex multiply connected three-dimensional networks both display nonuniversal character. Growing films have two-dimensional morphology but a three-dimensional percolation threshold and nonuniversal critical coefficients, yet similar silver films percolate as expected with universal coefficients. Growing gold however regresses to two-dimensional resistive behavior between 65% to 100% gold, and this regime lies along a single power-law curve shared by the hyperdimensional networks of gold, suggesting underlying symmetry governed by diffusion-limited aggregation. Models of data imply either hyperdimensionality or major internal property changes as density shifts. The distinctive flat spectral signature found near the percolation threshold is common to all highly porous samples and is explained quantitatively in terms of effective plasmonic response. Parameters from fits of effective medium models to optical and resistivity data are in close agreement, especially at the highest porosities. They imply an effective dimension which increases continuously as porosity grows via the increased branching needed for structural integrity. &&copy;2008 The American Physical Society.;Ford, M.J., Hoft, R.C., McDonagh, A.M. & Cortie, M.B. 2008, 'Rectification in donor-acceptor molecular junctions', Journal of Physics Condensed Matter, vol. 20, no. 37.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;We perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations on molecular junctions consisting of a single molecule between two Au(111) electrodes.

The treatment of cancer by this technique has recently received attention by others, but here we show how gold nanoparticle-based therapies can be developed to target live macrophage cells. We have employed 'active targeting', a scheme in which gold nanoparticles are functionalised with an antibody specific to the target macrophage cell.

It was found that the Li alloying processes occurred in the voltage range of 0 to 0.25 V, while de-alloying occurred in two stages at about 0.15 and 0.45V. This is significantly lower than in the Li-Sn or Li-Sn-Cu systems (0.2-1.0V) but comparable to that reported for thin, solid gold anodes.

Our gold films with void density f above 70% have high thermal emittance for a conductor at their thicknesses and their flat spectral response at visible and near infrared wavelengths is not metal like. We derive effective optical constants which become plasmonic at wavelengths between 1.8 and 4?m for f from 72 to 87%. This onset is much longer than that in bulk gold. For void densities below 70% the onset of plasmonic behaviour is much closer to the dense material. A simple test is implemented to test for surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) under illumination. The more porous films show no evidence of SPP, while the less porous films display weak evidence. Thus by tailoring void content in these nanostructures we can tailor the onset of effective plasmonic response across a wide range from 0.8 to 4?m and emittance from around 0.9 down to low values.

A high purity (99.99%) gold billet of 10 mm diameter, was processed with up to 9 repeated extrusion passes, using the ECAE technique. Mechanical properties of the extruded gold were determined by microhardness and nanoindentation measurements. It was found that the gold sample was substantially hardened after the 1st extrusion pass, with a microhardness increase from?30 HV to?60 HV. The hardness continued to increase with further extrusions, but at a lower hardening rate. After 9 extrusion passes, a microhardness of ~80 HV was achieved. Grain refinement of the extruded gold was assessed after the 9 extrusion passes via electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis.

The electrodes show near-ideal capacitor behaviour under both cyclic voltammetry and potential-step conditions. The higher capacitance of the mesoporous electrodes leads to a better dynamic range in potential-step experiments, resulting in improved accuracy of measurement.

The relationship between optical absorption of the metal nanosphere and the ability of the NP lens to reconstruct the near field is one to one. Metals with low dielectric losses have large plasmon absorption cross-sections and absorb over a very narrow wavelength range, they are consequently excellent materials for superlenses. Numerical solutions to Mie theory were used to calculate the absorption efficiency, Qabs, for nanospheres varying in radius between 5 and 100 nm in vacuum. We show that, although silver is the most commonly used material for superlensing, its absorption efficiency, as a nanosphere, at the plasmon resonance is not as strong as materials such as the alkali metals. Of all these materials, potassium spheres with a radius of 21 nm have an optimum absorption efficiency of 14.7, resulting in the ability of a film with thickness of 40 nm to reconstruct a grating with a period of 57 nm. &&copy;2007 Elsevier B.V.

In most cases, the clusters do not exhibit a sharp transition from a solid-like phase to a liquid-like phase, but rather pass through a region of transformations between structural isomers that extends over a considerable temperature range. Solid-like behaviour is observed in the atomic trajectories of the simulation at temperatures up to, or above, the bulk melting point. The 20-atom tetrahedral structure is the one exception, showing a sharp transition between solid-like and liquid-like phases at about 1200 K.

The method of fabrication used imparts a significant anisotropy to the geometric and optical properties of the coating. The optical-absorption properties of these deposits have been measured using UV-vis spectrometry and simulated using a code based on the discrete dipole approximation. Because the nanocaps are not interconnected, they interact with incident light as individual particles with a plasmon resonance that depends upon wavelength and the polarization vector of the light. The resulting extinction peaks manifest in the upper visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Surprisingly, varying the angle of incidence of the light (for a fixed polarization) has no effect on the optical properties of individual nanocaps.

It is known that they are composite structures of aragonite, other calcereous materials, and up to 5% by volume of protein 'glue'. A large component of their toughening derives from crack tip blunting, deflection and closure, concepts well-known from the field of fracture mechanics. However, the possibility that they might also derive a measure of toughening from a residual stress distribution has been generally overlooked, although Illert first raised this over a decade ago. The optimum situation would be when the inner surface of the shell is maintained in a state of tensile stress, while the outer layers are in the necessarily counter-balancing compressive state.

The methodology was tested with I-V data measured for an Au{111}-?,?'-p-xylyldithiol-Au nanoparticle system in air. About 25 eV can be stored on the nanoparticles using a charging voltage of 3 V, corresponding to up to twenty electrons. However, leakage of the charge will occur by tunneling in approximately 610-9 s. Therefore, these nanocapacitors would discharge completely in any electric circuit slower than about 1.5 GHz. &&copy;2005 IEEE.;Maaroof, A.I., Cortie, M.B. & Smith, G.B. 2005, 'Optical properties of mesoporous gold films', Journal of Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics, vol. 7, no. 7, pp. 303-309.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Mesoporous gold thin films on glass substrates were fabricated by sputtering of AuAl2 precursor films followed by a de-alloying etch. The resulting sponge-like Au films have very high internal surface area due to nanoscale pores and channels. Scattering is not significant and the optical properties for such nanostructured films were examined using ellipsometry and spectrophotometry. The complex refractive indices of the optically equivalent uniform smooth layer satisfy Kramers-Kronig (KK) self-consistency but have unusual dispersion relations and magnitudes for a film containing the amount of noble metal present. The reflectance at infrared wavelengths is neither metal-nor insulator-like, and the indices have unique dispersion curves. &&copy;2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.;Peceros, K.E., Xu, X., Bulcock, S.R. & Cortie, M.B. 2005, 'Dipole - Dipole plasmon interactions in gold-on-polystyrene composites', Journal of Physical Chemistry B, vol. 109, no. 46, pp. 21516-21520.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Red-shifting of the optical absorption spectra of aggregates of gold nanoparticles by dipole - dipole interactions is of considerable interest, both for theoretical reasons and because the phenomenon can be potentially exploited in various applications. A convenient and practical way to control the effect is to assemble the aggregated ensemble of n gold nanoparticles on the outer surface of larger dielectric spheres. Here, we show by experiment and calculation how the spectra of these structures can be systematically morphed from that of isolated gold particles, through the regime of broad absorption dominated by particle - particle interactions, and finally to the limiting case of a continuous nanoshell. The experimental data were produced using the process of deposition-precipitation, which provides a facile method to decorate polystyrene microspheres with gold nanoparticles. There is no need for prior functionalization of the microsphere surface in our method of deposition-precipitation. Calculations were carried out using a code based on the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The spectra were dominated by three effects. These were a peak absorption at about 540 nm produced by the conventional plasmon resonance of spherical gold nanoparticles, a broad absorption in the range 600-900 nm caused by diverse dipole - dipole interactions between particles, which strengthened as the number of attached gold particles increased and finally, when n was large, an absorption peak due to the onset of nanoshelllike resonances. The experimental spectra could be successfully fitted by spectra calculated using combinations of these effects. &&copy;2005 American Chemical Society.;Chowdhury, H., Xu, X., Huynh, P. & Cortie, M.B. 2005, 'Radiative heat transfer across glass coated with gold nano-particles', Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, Transactions of the ASME, vol. 127, no. 1, pp. 70-75.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Solar glazing based on reflective or absorptive coatings of noble metals or dielectric compounds respectively is well-known.

Although ordinary spherical aluminium nanoparticles have a plasmon resonance in the ultra-violet, the 'nano-caps' show plasmon absorption between 700 and 1200 nm due to their geometry. The position of their extinction peaks can be tuned by varying the thickness of the aluminium and the shape of the nano-cap. The optical properties of these shapes were modelled using the discrete dipole approximation method, which confirmed that the 'caps' have very significantly red-shifted absorbance and scattering compared to spheres.

The sponges have a high specific surface area, with an average pore diameter of 12 nm, but are prone to sinter. They may be prepared in bulk, or, more usefully, as coatings. Their electrochemical capacitance divided by their nominal surface area is high and, at a cell voltage of 0.6 V, reaches 100 mF/cm2 for bulk samples and 2 mF/cm2 for coatings.

In all three cases the bond energy between the thiolate radical and surface is typical of a covalent bond, and is of the order of 40 kcal mol-1. For the (1 1 1) surface the fcc hollow site is slightly more stable than the bridge site. For the (1 0 0) surfaces the four-fold hollow is clearly the most stable, and for the reconstructed (1 1 0) surface the bridge/edge sites either side of the first layer atoms are preferred. The calculated differences in binding energy between the three surfaces indicate that the thiolate will preferentially bind to the Au(1 1 0) or (1 0 0) before (1 1 1) surface, by about 10 kcal mol-1. The (1 1 0) surface is slightly more favourable than the (1 0 0), although the energy difference is only 3 kcal mol-1.

The green component can then be converted back into metallic form by an appropriate heat treatment that raises the temperature above that at which sigma phase is stable, causing the material to revert to the ferritic structure. Under appropriate conditions, sintering and consolidation of the compact can be arranged to occur at this time. The sintering treatment must be followed by a fast cool to room temperature in order to prevent reversion to sigma phase.

In particular, prior treatments of the glass substrate in 1:1 sulfuric acid (H 2SO4), 98% H2SO4 and buffered hydrofluoric acid (HF) exerted a strong influence on the subsequent particle size and coverage, which is explained here in terms of contact angle and its effect on rates of nucleation. The rate of nucleation on the surface treated with HF is estimated to be twice that of the surface treated with 98% H 2SO4. The color of the coatings is the result of inter-particle plasmonic interactions and is, therefore, also controlled by the nature of nucleation and growth process. &&copy;2005 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that the optical properties of the coating can be controlled by the pH of the deposition solution. At a pH of 5.1, the color of the coatings develops from pink, through violet, to blue in transmission. This is due to a plasmon resonance peak at 520 nm from isolated particles, and one at about 700 nm due to near-field dipole interactions, with an intermediate zone of the coexistence of the two, which produces the violet color. However, the two peaks do not coexist in the spectra of coatings produced at pH 8.0 or 10.0, with the peak due to the 520 nm resonance being swamped by the development of the resonance due to particle-particle interactions. In all cases the 700 nm peak could be broadened and red-shifted by increasing the deposition time. The reasons for these differences are explored and are shown to be attributable to the smaller, more aggregated morphology of nanoparticles precipitated at the higher pHs. The wavelength of maximum plasmon resonance is examined as a function of the volume fraction of nanoparticles. Significant deviations from the well-known Genzel-Martin analytical model are observed. The reasons for deviation of the model are discussed. Finally, it is shown how coatings that are blue or blue-gray in transmission can be obtained by exploiting this deviation. Such coatings may be more suitable for architectural application than the conventional pink-hued coatings obtained with colloidal gold nanoparticles.;Cortie, M.B. 2004, 'The weird world of nanoscale gold', Gold Bulletin, vol. 37, no. 1-2, pp. 12-19.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Ford, M. & Cortie, M.B. 2004, 'Nanotechnology, nanoscience and nanohype', Chemistry in Australia, vol. 73, no. 3, p. 2.;Ekanayake, S.R., Cortie, M.B. & Ford, M.J. 2004, 'Design of nanocapacitors and associated materials challenges', Current Applied Physics, vol. 4, no. 2-4, pp. 250-254.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) projects that the spatial resolution of feature sizes in integrated circuits is rapidly approaching nanoscopic dimensions.

A Lennard-Jones and many-body potential have been used in the empirical calculations, while the first principles calculations employ an atomic orbital, density functional technique. For the smaller clusters (n=3-5) the potential energy surface has been mapped at the ab initio level and for larger clusters an empirical potential was first used to identify low energy candidates which were then optimised with full ab initio calculations. At the DFT-LDA level, planar structures persist up to six atoms and are considerably more stable than the cage structures by more than 0.1 eV/atom. The difference in ab initio energy between the most stable planar and cage structures for seven atoms is only 0.04 eV/atom. For larger clusters there are generally a number of minima in the potential energy surface lying very close in energy. Furthermore our calculations do not predict ordered structures for the magic numbers n=13 and 38. They do predict the ordered tetrahedral structure for n=20.

These sizes lie far below the 200 nm or so that can be resolved with an optical microscope, and are closer in size to the 0.3 nm diameter of individual atoms. The field of nanotechnology is attracting keen interest at present. The excitement is motivated by the observation that control of matter at the nanoscale holds the promise of, amongst others, faster computing, better medicines, and more useful materials. In this paper, the physical phenomena on which this optimism is based are broadly discussed and explained.

There are a number of curious aspects to catalysis by gold that are currently attracting academic investigation, while the observation that gold-based catalysts are active at room temperature and below is driving considerable industrial interest. However, much is still not understood about these catalysts and, for example, apparently similar preparation techniques result in activities of hugely varying magnitude. In the present paper we assess the known phenomenology of heterogeneous catalysis by gold, with particular reference to the material properties of the individual nano-particles of catalyst and the many disagreements in the literature. Even the structure of the nano-particles is uncertain, with claims being made for truncated octahedra, cub-octahedra, icosahedra, various kinds of decahedra, and amorphous structures. As far as uncertainty concerning the mechanism of catalysis is concerned, we show that the situation has not yet been resolved, with evidence that catalysis can proceed even in the absence of either a discrete particulate morphology or an oxide support. One possibility is that more than one mechanism applies. Alternatively, the explanation may be that the activity of gold as a catalyst is determined only by the availability of surface gold atoms with low coordination numbers and an associated electron density suitable for whatever reaction is being catalysed. In this case, the role of the oxide support and of gold particle size and structure is indirect, and they would serve mainly to modulate the specific surface area of the gold, and the electronic configuration of its surface atoms.;Cortie, M.B. & Levey, F.C. 2002, 'Formation, modulation and adaptive twinning of martensite in the Au7Cu5Al4 shape memory system', Intermetallics, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 23-31.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The Au7Cu5Al4? electron phase transforms displacively from an L21 parent to a nominally body-centred tetragonal martensite with c/a1.

Analysis of its X-ray diffraction spectra indicates that the martensite is modulated by a [110]/[[110][1?10]]transverse shear wave, showing that it belongs, strictly speaking, to the generic B19 structure type. The martensite is also twinned, and the probable twinning structure is explored. A 15R(9,6?) stacking sequence is deduced, which for reasons of the L21 ordering inherited from the parent phase, must be doubled to produce a notional 30R(9,6?,9,6?) martensite that properly repeats.

    "Expertise": "Liz Harry’s primary research interest is how bacterial cells divide and how they regulate this process. Cell division is essential for survival, colonisation and infection. What are the cues that signal cells to divide at the right place and at the right time? How do cells ensure that when division occurs to produce two newborn cells, each one receives the correct amount of DNA? The answers to these questions are essential to understand how organisms reproduce and grow. But they remain unknown. Research in Liz’s laboratory addresses these questions in bacteria to gain an understanding of the regulation of this vital process both in culture and in the host during infection to facilitate the design of novel therapeutics that target it.;Liz has successfully partnered with industry in the areas of antimicrobial drug discovery and natural product therapeutics.;Can supervise: Yes;Subject Coordinator and Lecturer for Introductory Pharmacology and Microbiology to Bachelor of Nursing and Bachelor of Midwifery students at UTS.;Antibiotic Resistance Tutorial, 2nd year Bachelor of Biotechnology students at UTS.;Chapters;Conferences;Journal articles;Chapters;Monahan, L.G., D'Elia, M. & Harry, L. 2011, 'Mining bacterial cell division for new antibacterial drugs' in Miller, A.A. & Miller, P.F.

Poor financial investment in antibiotic research has exacerbated the situation. A call to arms raised by several prestigious scientific organisations a few years ago rallied the scientific community, and now the scope of antibacterial research has broadened considerably. Multi-disciplinary approaches have yielded a wealth of new data on areas ranging from the identification of novel antibacterial targets to the use of biological agents for antibacterial therapy.;Herbert, B. & Harry, E. 2009, 'Difficult proteins.', pp. 47-63.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The degree of protein diversity and dynamic range within organisms means that even the simplest proteome cannot be captured by any single extraction and separation step. New techniques have focused on major protein classes often under-represented in proteome analysis, low abundance, membrane, and alkaline proteins. The last decade has seen considerable technology development in fractionation tools aimed at complexity reduction in many forms. The key outcome of complexity reduction is that each fraction, or sub-proteome, can be studied in more detail, and proteins which would have remained undetected in a total extract are present in sufficient quantities. However, the tools available are fractionations, not amplifications, and like all mining for rare and difficult items, a large amount of starting material is often required. The key shortcomings of many proteome analysis techniques are now well documented. With this knowledge, the best modern proteomics 'platform' involves combining multiple protein extractions, gel and chromatographic separations, and multiple MS analysis methods.;Harry, E., Monahan, L. & Thompson, L. 2006, 'Bacterial Cell Division: The Mechanism and Its Precison', pp. 27-94.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The recent development of cell biology techniques for bacteria to allow visualization of fundamental processes in time and space, and their use in synchronous populations of cells, has resulted in a dramatic increase in our understanding of cell division and its regulation in these tiny cells. The first stage of cell division is the formation of a Z ring, composed of a polymerized tubulin-like protein, FtsZ, at the division site precisely at midcell. Several membrane-associated division proteins are then recruited to this ring to form a complex, the divisome, which causes invagination of the cell envelope layers to form a division septum. The Z ring marks the future division site, and the timing of assembly and positioning of this structure are important in determining where and when division will take place in the cell. Z ring assembly is controlled by many factors including negative regulatory mechanisms such as Min and nucleoid occlusion that influence Z ring positioning and FtsZ accessory proteins that bind to FtsZ directly and modulate its polymerization behavior. The replication status of the cell also influences the positioning of the Z ring, which may allow the tight coordination between DNA replication and cell division required to produce two identical newborn cells. &&copy;2006 Elsevier Inc.

Tubulin is a major component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, controlling cell shape, structure and dynamics, whereas its bacterial homologue FtsZ establishes the cytokinetic ring that constricts during cell division. How such different roles of tubulin and FtsZ evolved is unknown. Studying Archaea may provide clues as these organisms share characteristics with Eukarya and Bacteria. Here we report the structure and function of proteins from a distinct family related to tubulin and FtsZ, named CetZ, which co-exists with FtsZ in many archaea. CetZ X-ray crystal structures showed the FtsZ/tubulin superfamily fold, and one crystal form contained sheets of protofilaments, suggesting a structural role. However, inactivation of CetZ proteins in Haloferax volcanii did not affect cell division. Instead, CetZ1 was required for differentiation of the irregular plate-shaped cells into a rod-shaped cell type that was essential for normal swimming motility. CetZ1 formed dynamic cytoskeletal structures in vivo, relating to its capacity to remodel the cell envelope and direct rod formation. CetZ2 was also implicated in H. volcanii cell shape control. Our findings expand the known roles of the FtsZ/tubulin superfamily to include archaeal cell shape dynamics, suggesting that a cytoskeletal role might predate eukaryotic cell evolution, and they support the premise that a major function of the microbial rod shape is to facilitate swimming.;Liu, M., Lu, J., Müller, P., Turnbull, L., Burke, C.M., Schlothauer, R.C., Carter, D.A., Whitchurch, C.B. & Harry, E.J. 2015, 'Antibiotic-specific differences in the response of Staphylococcus aureus to treatment with antimicrobials combined with manuka honey', Frontiers in Microbiology, vol. 6, no.

Skin infections caused by antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus are a significant health problem worldwide, often associated with high treatment cost and mortality rate. Complex natural products like New Zealand (NZ) manuka honey have been revisited and studied extensively as an alternative to antibiotics due to their potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and the inability to isolate honey-resistant S. aureus. Previous studies showing synergistic effects between manuka-type honeys and antibiotics have been demonstrated against the growth of one methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain. We have previously demonstrated strong synergistic activity between NZ manuka-type honey and rifampicin against growth and biofilm formation of multiple S. arueus strains. Here, we have expanded our investigation using multiple S. aureus strains and four different antibiotics commonly used to treat S. aureus-related skin infections: rifampicin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin. Using checkerboard microdilution and agar diffusion assays with S. aureus strains including clinical isolates and MRSA we demonstrate that manuka-type honey combined with these four antibiotics frequently produces a synergistic effect. In some cases when synergism was not observed, there was a significant enhancement in antibiotic susceptibility. Some strains that were highly resistant to an antibiotic when present alone become sensitive to clinically achievable concentrations when combined with honey. However, not all of the S. aureus strains tested responded in the same way to these combinational treatments. Our findings support the use of NZ manuka-type honeys in clinical treatment against S. aureus-related infections and extend their potential use as an antibiotic adjuvant in combinational therapy. Our data also suggest that manuka-type honeys may not work as antibiotic adjuvants for all strains of...;Campbell, L.T., Simonin, A.R., Chen, C., Ferdous, J., Padula, M.P., Harry, E., Hofer, M., Campbell, I.L. & Carter, D.A. 2015, 'Cryptococcus strains with different pathogenic potentials have diverse protein secretomes', Eukaryotic Cell, vol. 14, no. 6, pp. 554-563.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;copy;2015 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved. Secreted proteins are the frontline between the host and pathogen. In mammalian hosts, secreted proteins enable invasive infection and can modulate the host immune response. Cryptococcosis, caused by pathogenic Cryptococcus species, begins when inhaled infectious propagules establish to produce pulmonary infection, which, if not resolved, can disseminate to the central nervous system to cause meningoencephalitis. Strains of Cryptococcus species differ in their capacity to cause disease, and the mechanisms underlying this are not well understood. To investigate the role of secreted proteins in disease, we determined the secretome for three genome strains of Cryptococcus species, including a hypovirulent and a hypervirulent strain of C. gattii and a virulent strain of C. neoformans. Sixty-seven unique proteins were identified, with different numbers and types of proteins secreted by each strain. The secretomes of the virulent strains were largely limited to proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes, while the hypovirulent strain had a diverse secretome, including non-conventionally secreted canonical cytosolic and immunogenic proteins that have been implicated in virulence. The hypovirulent strain cannot establish pulmonary infection in a mouse model, but strains of this genotype have caused human meningitis. To directly test brain infection, we used intracranial inoculation and found that the hypovirulent strain was substantially more invasive than its hypervirulent counterpart. We suggest that immunogenic proteins secreted by this strain invoke a host response that limits pulmonary infection but that there can be invasive growth and damage if infection reaches the brain. Given their known role in virulence, it is possible that non-conventionally secreted proteins mediate this process.;Monahan, L.G. & Harry, E.J. 2015, 'You Are What You Eat: Metabolic Control of Bacterial Division', Trends in Microbiology.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015. Fluctuations in nutrient availability are a fact of life for bacterial cells in the 'wild'. To survive and compete, bacteria must rapidly modulate cell-cycle processes to accommodate changing nutritional conditions and concomitant changes in cell growth. Our understanding of how this is achieved has been transformed in recent years, with cellular metabolism emerging as a central player. Several metabolic enzymes, in addition to their normal catalytic functions, have been shown to directly modulate cell-cycle processes in response to changing nutrient levels. Here we focus on cell division, the final event in the bacterial cell cycle, and discuss recent compelling evidence connecting division regulation to nutritional status and metabolic activity. Cellular metabolism has emerged as a key player in the nutritional regulation of bacterial division and other cell-cycle processes.A number of metabolic enzymes have been shown to directly influence division in response to nutrient status by modulating the activity of FtsZ, the master orchestrator of bacterial cytokinesis.The ability of metabolic enzymes to affect division is controlled at least in part by substrate levels, which serve as an intracellular reporter of nutrient availability.A diversity of metabolic regulatory mechanisms has been observed for division in different bacteria, hinting at evolution on a species-specific level.;Hajduk, I.V., Rodrigues, C.D.A. & Harry, E.J. 2015, 'Connecting the dots of the bacterial cell cycle: Coordinating chromosome replication and segregation with cell division', Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015. Proper division site selection is crucial for the survival of all organisms. What still eludes us is how bacteria position their division site with high precision, and in tight coordination with chromosome replication and segregation. Until recently, the general belief, at least in the model organisms Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, was that spatial regulation of division comes about by the combined negative regulatory mechanisms of the Min system and nucleoid occlusion. However, as we review here, these two systems cannot be solely responsible for division site selection and we highlight additional regulatory mechanisms that are at play. In this review, we put forward evidence of how chromosome replication and segregation may have direct links with cell division in these bacteria and the benefit of recent advances in chromosome conformation capture techniques in providing important information about how these three processes mechanistically work together to achieve accurate generation of progenitor cells.;Lu, J., Turnbull, L., Burke, C.M., Liu, M., Carter, D.A., Schlothauer, R.C., Whitchurch, C.B. & Harry, E.J. 2014, 'Manuka-type honeys can eradicate biofilms produced by Staphylococcus aureus strains with different biofilm-forming abilities', PeerJ, vol. 2014, no. 1.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Chronic wounds are a major global health problem. Their management is difficult and costly, and the development of antibiotic resistance by both planktonic and biofilm-associated bacteria necessitates the use of alternative wound treatments. Honey is now being revisited as an alternative treatment due to its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and the inability of bacteria to develop resistance to it. Many previous antibacterial studies have used honeys that are not well characterized, even in terms of quantifying the levels of the major antibacterial components present, making it difficult to build an evidence base for the efficacy of honey as an antibiofilm agent in chronic wound treatment. Here we show that a range of well-characterized New Zealand manuka-type honeys, in which two principle antibacterial components, methylglyoxal and hydrogen peroxide, were quantified, can eradicate biofilms of a range of Staphylococcus aureus strains that differ widely in their biofilm-forming abilities. Using crystal violet and viability assays, along with confocal laser scanning imaging, we demonstrate that in all S. aureus strains, including methicillin-resistant strains, the manuka-type honeys showed significantly higher anti-biofilm activity than clover honey and an isotonic sugar solution.We observed higher anti-biofilm activity as the proportion of manuka-derived honey, and thus methylglyoxal, in a honey blend increased. However, methylglyoxal on its own, or with sugar, was not able to effectively eradicate S. aureus biofilms.We also demonstrate that honey was able to penetrate through the biofilm matrix and kill the embedded cells in some cases. As has been reported for antibiotics, sub-inhibitory concentrations of honey improved biofilm formation by some S. aureus strains, however, biofilm cell suspensions recovered after honey treatment did not develop resistance towards manukatype honeys. New Zealand manuka-type honeys, at the concentrations they can be applied i...;Li, F., Harry, E.J., Bottomley, A.L., Edstein, M.D., Birrell, G.W., Woodward, C.E., Keene, F.R. & Collins, J.G. 2014, 'Dinuclear ruthenium(ii) antimicrobial agents that selectively target polysomes in vivo', Chemical Science, vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 685-693.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Wide-field fluorescence microscopy at high magnification was used to study the intracellular binding site of Rubb16 in Escherichia coli. Upon incubation of E. coli cells at the minimum inhibitory concentration, Rubb 16 localised at ribosomes with no significant DNA binding observed. Furthermore, Rubb16 condensed the ribosomes when they existed as polysomes. It is postulated that the condensation of polysomes would halt protein production, and thereby inhibit bacterial growth. The results of this study indicate that the family of inert dinuclear ruthenium complexes Rubb n selectively target RNA over DNA in vivo. Selective RNA targeting could be advantageous for the development of therapeutic agents, and because of differences in ribosome structure between bacteria and eukaryotic cells, the Rubbn complexes could be selectively toxic to bacteria. In support of this hypothesis, the toxicity of Rubb16 was found to be significantly less to liver and kidney cell lines than against a range of bacteria. &&copy;2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.;Monahan, L.G., Liew, A.T.F., Bottomley, A.L. & Harry, E.J. 2014, 'Division site positioning in bacteria: One size does not fit all', Frontiers in Microbiology, vol. 5, no. FEB.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Spatial regulation of cell division in bacteria has been a focus of research for decades. It has been well studied in two model rod-shaped organisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, with the general belief that division site positioning occurs as a result of the combination of two negative regulatory systems, Min and nucleoid occlusion. These systems influence division by preventing the cytokinetic Z ring from forming anywhere other than midcell. However, evidence is accumulating for the existence of additional mechanisms that are involved in controlling Z ring positioning both in these organisms and in several other bacteria. In some cases the decision of where to divide is solved by variations on a common evolutionary theme, and in others completely different proteins and mechanisms are involved. Here we review the different ways bacteria solve the problem of finding the right place to divide.

We describe the in vitro antibacterial properties of the NSAIDs carprofen, bromfenac, and vedaprofen, and show that these NSAIDs inhibit the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III? subunit, an essential interaction hub that acts as a mobile tether on DNA for many essential partner proteins in DNA replication and repair. Crystal structures show that the three NSAIDs bind to the sliding clamp at a common binding site required for partner binding. Inhibition of interaction of the clamp loader and/or the replicative polymerase? subunit with the sliding clamp is demonstrated using an in vitro DNA replication assay.

Imaging of biological samples using fluorescence microscopy has advanced substantially with new technologies to overcome the resolution barrier of the diffraction of light allowing super-resolution of live samples. There are currently three main types of super-resolution techniques;8211# stimulated emission depletion (STED), single-molecule localization microscopy (including techniques such as PALM, STORM, and GDSIM), and structured illumination microscopy (SIM). While STED and single-molecule localization techniques show the largest increases in resolution, they have been slower to offer increased speeds of image acquisition. Three-dimensional SIM (3D-SIM) is a wide-field fluorescence microscopy technique that offers a number of advantages over both single-molecule localization and STED. Resolution is improved, with typical lateral and axial resolutions of 110 and 280 nm, respectively and depth of sampling of up to 30 &&micro;m from the coverslip, allowing for imaging of whole cells. Recent advancements (fast 3D-SIM) in the technology increasing the capture rate of raw images allows for fast capture of biological processes occurring in seconds, while significantly reducing photo-toxicity and photobleaching Here we describe the use of one such method to image bacterial cells harboring the fluorescently-labelled cytokinetic FtsZ protein to show how cells are analyzed and the type of unique information that this technique can provide.;Cleverley, R.M., Barrett, J.R., Baslé, A., Bui, N.K., Hewitt, L., Solovyova, A., Xu, Z.Q., Daniel, R.A., Dixon, N.E., Harry, E.J., Oakley, A.J., Vollmer, W. & Lewis, R.J. 2014, 'Structure and function of a spectrin-like regulator of bacterial cytokinesis', Nature Communications, vol. 5.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved. Bacterial cell division is facilitated by a molecular machine - the divisome - that assembles at mid-cell in dividing cells. The formation of the cytokinetic Z-ring by the tubulin homologue FtsZ is regulated by several factors, including the divisome component EzrA. Here we describe the structure of the 60-kDa cytoplasmic domain of EzrA, which comprises five linear repeats of an unusual triple helical bundle. The EzrA structure is bent into a semicircle, providing the protein with the potential to interact at both N- and C-termini with adjacent membrane-bound divisome components. We also identify at least two binding sites for FtsZ on EzrA and map regions of EzrA that are responsible for regulating FtsZ assembly. The individual repeats, and their linear organization, are homologous to the spectrin proteins that connect actin filaments to the membrane in eukaryotes, and we thus propose that EzrA is the founding member of the bacterial spectrin family.;Liu, M., Lu, J., Müller, P., Turnbull, L., Burke, C.M., Schlothauer, R.C., Carter, D.A., Whitchurch, C.B. & Harry, E.J. 2014, 'Antibiotic-specific differences in the response of Staphylococcus aureus to treatment with antimicrobials combined with manuka honey', Frontiers in Microbiology, vol. 5, no.

Skin infections caused by antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus are a significant health problem worldwide, often associated with high treatment cost and mortality rate. Complex natural products like New Zealand (NZ) manuka honey have been revisited and studied extensively as an alternative to antibiotics due to their potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and the inability to isolate honey-resistant S. aureus. Previous studies showing synergistic effects between manuka-type honeys and antibiotics have been demonstrated against the growth of one methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain. We have previously demonstrated strong synergistic activity between NZ manukatype honey and rifampicin against growth and biofilm formation of multiple S. arueus strains. Here, we have expanded our investigation using multiple S. aureus strains and four different antibiotics commonly used to treat S. aureus-related skin infections: rifampicin, oxacillin, gentamicin and clindamycin. Using checkerboard microdilution and agar diffusion assays with S. aureus strains including clinical isolates and MRSA we demonstrate that manuka-type honey combined with these four antibiotics frequently produces a synergistic effect. In some cases when synergism was not observed, there was a significant enhancement in antibiotic susceptibility. Some strains that were highly resistant to an antibiotic when present alone become sensitive to clinically-achievable concentrations when combined with honey. However, not all of the S. aureus strains tested responded in the same way to these combinational treatments. Our findings support the use of NZ manuka-type honeys in clinical treatment against S. aureus-related infections and extend their potential use as an antibiotic adjuvant in combinational therapy. Our data also suggest that manuka-type honeys may not work as antibiotic adjuvants for all strains of...;Harry, E.J. 2014, 'Microbiology: A beacon for bacterial tubulin', Nature, vol. 516, no. 7530, pp. 175-176.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Monahan, L.G., Hajduk, I.V., Blaber, S.P., Charles, I.G. & Harry, E.J. 2014, 'Coordinating bacterial cell division with nutrient availability: A role for glycolysis', mBio, vol. 5, no. 3.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Cell division in bacteria is driven by a cytoskeletal ring structure, the Z ring, composed of polymers of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ. Z-ring formation must be tightly regulated to ensure faithful cell division, and several mechanisms that influence the positioning and timing of Z-ring assembly have been described. Another important but as yet poorly understood aspect of cell division regulation is the need to coordinate division with cell growth and nutrient availability. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that cell division is intimately linked to central carbon metabolism in the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We showed that a deletion of the gene encoding pyruvate kinase (pyk), which produces pyruvate in the final reaction of glycolysis, rescues the assembly defect of a temperature-sensitive ftsZ mutant and has significant effects on Z-ring formation in wild-type B. subtilis cells. Addition of exogenous pyruvate restores normal division in the absence of the pyruvate kinase enzyme, implicating pyruvate as a key metabolite in the coordination of bacterial growth and division. Our results support a model in which pyruvate levels are coupled to Z-ring assembly via an enzyme that actually metabolizes pyruvate, the E1? subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase. We have shown that this protein localizes over the nucleoid in a pyruvatedependent manner and may stimulate more efficient Z-ring formation at the cell center under nutrient-rich conditions, when cells must divide more frequently. &&copy;2014 Monahan et al.;Yin, Z., Whittell, L.R., Wang, Y., Jergic, S., Liu, M., Harry, E.J., Dixon, N.E., Beck, J.L., Kelso, M.J. & Oakley, A.J. 2014, 'Discovery of lead compounds targeting the bacterial sliding clamp using a fragment-based approach', Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 57, no. 6, pp. 2799-2806.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;The bacterial sliding clamp (SC), also known as the DNA polymerase III? subunit, is an emerging antibacterial target that plays a central role in DNA replication, serving as a protein-protein interaction hub with a common binding pocket to recognize linear motifs in the partner proteins.

Complex natural products with antimicrobial activity, such as honey, are now under the spotlight as alternative treatments to antibiotics. Several studies have shown honey to have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity at concentrations present in honey dressings, and resistance to honey has not been attainable in the laboratory. However not all honeys are the same and few studies have used honey that is well defined both in geographic and chemical terms. Here we have used a range of concentrations of clover honey and a suite of manuka and kanuka honeys from known geographical locations, and for which the floral source and concentration of methylglyoxal and hydrogen peroxide potential were defined, to determine their effect on growth and cellular morphology of four bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While the general trend in effectiveness of growth inhibition was manukamanuka-kanuka blendkanukaclover, the honeys had varying and diverse effects on the growth and cellular morphology of each bacterium, and each organism had a unique response profile to these honeys. P. aeruginosa showed a markedly different pattern of growth inhibition to the other three organisms when treated with sub-inhibitory concentrations of honey, being equally sensitive to all honeys, including clover, and the least sensitive to honey overall. While hydrogen peroxide potential contributed to the antibacterial activity of the manuka and kanuka honeys, it was never essential for complete growth inhibition. Cell morphology analysis also showed a varied and diverse set of responses to the honeys that included cell length changes, cell lysis, and alterations to DNA appearance. These changes are likely to reflect the different regulatory circuits of the organisms that are activated by the stress of honey treatment. &&copy;2013 Lu et al.;Müller, P., Alber, D.G., Turnbull, L., Schlothauer, R.C., Carter, D.A., Whitchurch, C.B. & Harry, E.J. 2013, 'Synergism between Medihoney and Rifampicin against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)', PLoS ONE, vol. 8, no. 2.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Skin and chronic wound infections caused by highly antibiotic resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are an increasing and urgent health problem worldwide, particularly with sharp increases in obesity and diabetes. New Zealand manuka honey has potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, has been shown to inhibit the growth of MRSA strains, and bacteria resistant to this honey have not been obtainable in the laboratory. Combinational treatment of chronic wounds with manuka honey and common antibiotics may offer a wide range of advantages including synergistic enhancement of the antibacterial activity, reduction of the effective dose of the antibiotic, and reduction of the risk of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Medihoney in combination with the widely used antibiotic rifampicin on S. aureus. Using checkerboard microdilution assays, time-kill curve experiments and agar diffusion assays, we show a synergism between Medihoney and rifampicin against MRSA and clinical isolates of S. aureus. Furthermore, the Medihoney/rifampicin combination stopped the appearance of rifampicin-resistant S. aureus in vitro. Methylglyoxal (MGO), believed to be the major antibacterial compound in manuka honey, did not act synergistically with rifampicin and is therefore not the sole factor responsible for the synergistic effect of manuka honey with rifampicin.

This ring subsequently recruits the division machinery to allow cytokinesis. How the Z ring is positioned correctly remains a challenging question in biology and our knowledge in this area has been restricted to a few model species. Spatial regulation of division in these bacteria has been considered to be negatively controlled, with Z rings assembling in the area of least inhibition: the cell centre. An article in this issue of Molecular Microbiology reports the discovery of a new protein in Myxococcus xanthus, called PomZ (Positioning at midcell of FtsZ), that is required for the efficient recruitment of the Z ring to the division site. PomZ is a member of the Mrp/Min family of P loop ATPases that includes a diverse range of proteins involved in spatial regulation in bacteria. PomZ is the first positive regulator of Z ring positioning to be identified in vegetatively growing bacterial cells. Positive spatial regulation of division has previously been observed during sporulation in Streptomyces coelicolor and has been suggested to occur in Bacillus subtilis. Perhaps this will emerge as a common theme in the future. &&copy;2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Chan, C.W., Deadman, B.J., Manley-Harris, M., Wilkins, A.L., Alber, D.G. & Harry, E. 2013, 'Analysis of the flavonoid component of bioactive New Zealand m?nuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey and the isolation, characterisation and synthesis of an unusual pyrrole', Food Chemistry, vol. 141, no. 3, pp. 1772-1781.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The flavonoid components of New Zealand m?nuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey have been quantified in a series of 31 honeys of varying non-peroxide antibacterial activity to clarify discrepancies between previous studies reported in the literature.

The aim of this study was to determine the non-peroxide antibacterial effects of this honey on the proteome of the common wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Proteomic analysis was performed on cells treated for a short time with manuka honey compared with the proteome of untreated cells as well as cells treated with a Leptospermum honey sample without antibacterial activity. Treatment with manuka honey resulted in a significant decrease in the bacterial cell growth rate as well as downregulation of ten and upregulation of two proteins. Nine of these proteins were also differentially expressed by cells treated with the inactive Leptospermum honey, but to a lesser degree, and the rate of bacterial growth was not affected. The differentially expressed proteins have roles in ribosomal function, protein synthesis, metabolic processes and transcription. Manuka honey uniquely caused downregulation of two proteins [dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) and elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu)] associated with two of these pathways as well as upregulation of one stress-related protein [cold shock protein C (CspC)]. The proteomic profile following treatment with manuka honey differed from the profiles of other antibacterial agents, indicating a unique mode of action and its potential value as a novel antimicrobial agent.

The current general view is that precise positioning of the division site at midcell in rod-shaped bacteria is a result of the combined action of the Min system and nucleoid (chromosome) occlusion. Both systems prevent assembly of the cytokinetic Z ring at inappropriate places in the cell, restricting Z rings to the correct site at midcell. Here we show that in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis Z rings are positioned precisely at midcell in the complete absence of both these systems, revealing the existence of a mechanism independent of Min and nucleoid occlusion that identifies midcell in this organism. We further show that Z ring assembly at midcell is delayed in the absence of Min and Noc proteins, while at the same time FtsZ accumulates at other potential division sites. This suggests that a major role for Min and Noc is to ensure efficient utilization of the midcell division site by preventing Z ring assembly at potential division sites, including the cell poles. Our data lead us to propose a model in which spatial regulation of division in B. subtilis involves identification of the division site at midcell that requires Min and nucleoid occlusion to ensure efficient Z ring assembly there and only there, at the right time in the cell cycle. &&copy;2012 Rodrigues, Harry.;Strauss, M.P., Liew, A.T.F., Turnbull, L., Whitchurch, C.B., Monahan, L.G. & Harry, E.J. 2012, '3D-SIM Super Resolution Microscopy Reveals a Bead-Like Arrangement for FtsZ and the Division Machinery: Implications for Triggering Cytokinesis', PLoS Biology, vol. 10, no. 9.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;FtsZ is a tubulin-like GTPase that is the major cytoskeletal protein in bacterial cell division. It polymerizes into a ring, called the Z ring, at the division site and acts as a scaffold to recruit other division proteins to this site as well as providing a contractile force for cytokinesis. To understand how FtsZ performs these functions, the in vivo architecture of the Z ring needs to be established, as well as how this structure constricts to enable cytokinesis. Conventional wide-field fluorescence microscopy depicts the Z ring as a continuous structure of uniform density. Here we use a form of super resolution microscopy, known as 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM), to examine the architecture of the Z ring in cells of two Gram-positive organisms that have different cell shapes: the rod-shaped Bacillus subtilis and the coccoid Staphylococcus aureus. We show that in both organisms the Z ring is composed of a heterogeneous distribution of FtsZ. In addition, gaps of fluorescence were evident, which suggest that it is a discontinuous structure. Time-lapse studies using an advanced form of fast live 3D-SIM (Blaze) support a model of FtsZ localization within the Z ring that is dynamic and remains distributed in a heterogeneous manner. However, FtsZ dynamics alone do not trigger the constriction of the Z ring to allow cytokinesis. Lastly, we visualize other components of the divisome and show that they also adopt a bead-like localization pattern at the future division site. Our data lead us to propose that FtsZ guides the divisome to adopt a similar localization pattern to ensure Z ring constriction only proceeds following the assembly of a mature divisome. &&copy;2012 Strauss et al.;Chong, H.S., Campbell, L., Padula, M.P., Hill, C., Harry, E., Li, S.S., Wilkins, M.R., Herbert, B. & Carter, D. 2012, 'Time-course proteome analysis reveals the dynamic response of cryptococcus gattii cells to fluconazole', PLoS ONE, vol. 7, no. 8.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Cryptococcus gattii is an encapsulated fungus capable of causing fatal disease in immunocompetent humans and animals.

This vector also contains a multiple cloning site downstream of the IPTG-inducible Pspac promoter for insertion of the gene of interest. Production of encoded proteins can be stringently regulated in an IPTG-dependent manner by introducing a pE194-based plasmid, pGL485, carrying a constitutively expressed lacI gene. Using GFP fusions to two essential proteins of S. aureus, FtsZ and NusA, we showed that our plasmid allowed tightly controlled gene expression and accurate localization of fusion proteins with no detrimental effect on cells at low inducer concentrations. At higher IPTG concentrations, we obtained sixfold overproduction of protein compared with wild-type levels, with FtsZ-GFP-expressing cells showing lysis and delocalized fluorescence, while NusA-GFP showed only delocalized fluorescence.

FtsZ plays a pivotal role in bacterial division, and is present in virtually all prokaryotes and in some eukaryotic organelles. The earliest stage of bacterial cell division is the assembly of FtsZ into a Z ring at the division site, which subsequently constricts during cytokinesis. FtsZ also assembles into dynamic helical structures along the bacterial cell, which are thought to act as precursors to the Z ring via a cell cycle-mediated FtsZ polymer remodelling. The fine structures of the FtsZ helix and ring are unknown but crucial for identifying the molecular details of Z ring assembly and its regulation. We now reveal using STED microscopy that the FtsZ helical structure in cells of the gram positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, is a highly irregular and discontinuous helix of FtsZ, very different to the smooth cable-like appearance observed by conventional fluorescence optics. STED also identifies a novel FtsZ helical structure of smaller pitch that is invisible to standard optical methods, identifying a possible third intermediate in the pathway to Z ring assembly, which commits bacterial cells to divide. &&copy;2010.;Brzoska, A.J., Withers, R., Turner, K.M., Robinson, A., Dixon, N., Harry, L. & Lewis, P. 2010, 'Identification of novel drug targets using model organisms', Microbiology Australia, vol.

Studies using outgrown spores of Bacillus subtilis have shown that inhibiting the early stages of DNA replication, leading up to assembly of the replisome at oriC, influences Z ring positioning. Here we examine whether Z ring formation at midcell under various conditions of DNA replication inhibition is solely the result of relief of nucleoid occlusion. We show that midcell Z rings form preferentially over unreplicated nucleoids that have a bilobed morphology (lowering DNA concentration at midcell), whereas acentral Z rings form beside a single-lobed nucleoid. Remarkably however, when the DnaB replication initiation protein is inactivated midcell Z rings never form over bilobed nucleoids. Relieving nucleoid occlusion by deleting noc increased midcell Z ring frequency for all situations of DNA replication inhibition, however not to the same extent, with the DnaB-inactivated strain having the lowest frequency of midcell Z rings. We propose an additional mechanism for Z ring positioning in which the division site becomes increasingly potentiated for Z ring formation as initiation of replication is progressively completed. &&copy;2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Robinson, A., Brzoska, A.J., Turner, K.M., Withers, R., Harry, E.J., Lewis, P.J. & Dixon, N.E. 2010, 'Essential biological processes of an emerging pathogen: DNA replication, transcription, and cell division in Acinetobacter spp.', Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, vol. 74, no. 2, pp. 273-297.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Within the last 15 years, members of the bacterial genus Acinetobacter have risen from relative obscurity to be among the most important sources of hospital-acquired infections. The driving force for this has been the remarkable ability of these organisms to acquire antibiotic resistance determinants, with some strains now showing resistance to every antibiotic in clinical use. There is an urgent need for new antibacterial compounds to combat the threat imposed by Acinetobacter spp. and other intractable bacterial pathogens. The essential processes of chromosomal DNA replication, transcription, and cell division are attractive targets for the rational design of antimicrobial drugs. The goal of this review is to examine the wealth of genome sequence and gene knockout data now available for Acinetobacter spp., highlighting those aspects of essential systems that are most suitable as drug targets. Acinetobacter spp. show several key differences from other pathogenic gammaproteobacteria, particularly in global stress response pathways. The involvement of these pathways in short- and long-term antibiotic survival suggests that Acinetobacter spp. cope with antibiotic-induced stress differently from other microorganisms.

In the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, much less is known about the regulation of replication initiation, specifically, regarding negative control mechanisms which ensure replication initiation only once per cell cycle. Here we report that replication initiation was greatly enhanced in strains that had the origin of replication (oriC) relocated to various loci on the chromosome. When oriC was relocated to new loci further than 250 kb counterclockwise from the native locus, replication initiation became asynchronous and earlier than in the wild-type cells. In two oriC-relocated strains (oriC at argG or pnbA, 257&&deg;or 300&&deg;on the 360&&deg;chromosome map, respectively), DnaA levels were higher than in the wild-type but not enough to cause earlier initiation of replication. Our results suggest that the initiation capacity of replication is accumulated well before the actual time of initiation, and its release may be suppressed by a unique DNA structure formed near the native oriC locus. &&copy;2009 SGM.;Blair, S.E., Cokcetin, N.N., Harry, E.J. & Carter, D.A. 2009, 'The unusual antibacterial activity of medical-grade Leptospermum honey: Antibacterial spectrum, resistance and transcriptome analysis', European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, vol. 28, no. 10, pp. 1199-1208.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;There is an urgent need for new, effective agents in topical wound care, and selected honeys show potential in this regard. Using a medical-grade honey, eight species of problematic wound pathogens, including those with high levels of innate or acquired antibiotic resistance, were killed by 4.0-14.8% honey, which is a concentration that can be maintained in the wound environment. Resistance to honey could not be induced under conditions that rapidly induced resistance to antibiotics. Escherichia coli macroarrays were used to determine the response of bacterial cells to a sub-lethal dose of honey. The pattern of gene expression differed to that reported for other antimicrobial agents, indicating that honey acts in a unique and multifactorial way, 78 (2%) genes were upregulated and 46 (1%) genes were downregulated more than two-fold upon exposure to the medical-grade honey. Most of the upregulated genes clustered into distinct functional regulatory groups, with many involved in stress responses, and the majority of downregulated genes encoded for products involved in protein synthesis. Taken together, these data indicate that honey is an effective topical antimicrobial agent that could help reduce some of the current pressures that are promoting antibiotic resistance. &&copy;2009 Springer-Verlag.;Monahan, L.G., Robinson, A. & Harry, E.J. 2009, 'Lateral FtsZ association and the assembly of the cytokinetic Z ring in bacteria', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 74, no. 4, pp. 1004-1017.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Cell division in bacteria is facilitated by a polymeric ring structure, the Z ring, composed of tubulin-like FtsZ protofilaments. Recently it has been shown that in Bacillus subtilis, the Z ring forms through the cell cycle-mediated remodelling of a helical FtsZ polymer. To investigate how this occurs in vivo, we have exploited a unique temperature-sensitive strain of B. subtilis expressing the mutant protein FtsZ(Ts1). FtsZ(Ts1) is unable to complete Z ring assembly at 49&&deg;C, becoming trapped at an intermediate stage in the helix-to-ring progression. To determine why this is the case, we used a combination of methods to identify the specific defect of the FtsZ(Ts1) protein in vivo. Our results indicate that while FtsZ(Ts1) is able to polymerize normally into protofilaments, it is defective in the ability to support lateral associations between these filaments at high temperatures. This strongly suggests that lateral FtsZ association plays a crucial role in the polymer transitions that lead to the formation of the Z ring in the cell. In addition, we show that the FtsZ-binding protein ZapA, when overproduced, can rescue the FtsZ(Ts1) defect in vivo. This suggests that ZapA functions to promote the helix-to-ring transition of FtsZ by stimulating lateral FtsZ association. &&copy;2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Wadsworth, K.D., Rowland, S.L., Harry, E.J. & King, G.F. 2008, 'The divisomal protein DivIB contains multiple epitopes that mediate its recruitment to incipient division sites', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 67, no. 5, pp. 1143-1155.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Bacterial cytokinesis is orchestrated by an assembly of essential cell division proteins that form a supramolecular structure known as the divisome. DivIB and its orthologue FtsQ are essential members of the divisome in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria respectively. DivIB is a bitopic membrane protein composed of an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal extracytoplasmic region comprised of three separate protein domains. A molecular dissection approach was used to determine which of these domains are essential for recruitment of DivIB to incipient division sites and for its cell division functions. We show that DivIB has three molecular epitopes that mediate its localization to division septa, two epitopes are encoded within the extracytoplasmic region while the third is located in the transmembrane domain. It is proposed that these epitopes represent sites of interaction with other divisomal proteins, and we have used this information to develop a model of the way in which DivIB and FtsQ are integrated into the divisome. Remarkably, two of the three DivIB localization epitopes are dispensable for vegetative cell division, this suggests that the divisome is assembled using a complex network of protein-protein interactions, many of which are redundant and likely to be individually non-essential. &&copy;2008 The Authors.;Lock, R.L. & Harry, E.J. 2008, 'Cell-division inhibitors: new insights for future antibiotics', Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, vol. 7, no. 4, pp. 324-338.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Lock, R.L. & Harry, E.J. 2008, 'Cell-division inhibitors: new insights for future antibiotics.', Nature reviews.

The wealth of knowledge available about the bacterial cell-division pathway has aided target-driven approaches to identify novel inhibitors. Here, we discuss the therapeutic potential of inhibiting bacterial cell division, and review the progress made in this exciting new area of antibacterial discovery.;Peters, P.C., Migocki, M.D., Thoni, C. & Harry, E.J. 2007, 'A new assembly pathway for the cytokinetic Z ring from a dynamic helical structure in vegetatively growing cells of Bacillus subtilis', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 64, no. 2, pp. 487-499.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The earliest event in bacterial cell division is the formation of a Z ring, composed of the tubulin-like FtsZ protein, at the division site at midcell. This ring then recruits several other division proteins and together they drive the formation of a division septum between two replicated chromosomes. Here we show that, in addition to forming a cytokinetic ring, FtsZ localizes in a helical-like pattern in vegetatively growing cells of Bacillus subtilis. FtsZ moves rapidly within this helix-like structure. Examination of FtsZ localization in individual live cells undergoing a single cell cycle suggests a new assembly mechanism for Z ring formation that involves a cell cycle-mediated multistep remodelling of FtsZ polymers. Our observations suggest that initially FtsZ localizes in a helical pattern, with movement of FtsZ within this structure occurring along the entire length of the cell. Next, movement of FtsZ in a helical-like pattern is restricted to a central region of the cell. Finally the FtsZ ring forms precisely at midcell. We further show that another division protein, FtsA, shown to interact with FtsZ prior to Z ring formation in B. subtilis, also localizes to similar helical patterns in vegetatively growing cells. &&copy;2007 The Authors.;Michie, K.A., Monahan, L.G., Beech, P.L. & Harry, E.J. 2006, 'Trapping of a spiral-like intermediate of the bacterial cytokinetic protein FtsZ', Journal of Bacteriology, vol. 188, no. 5, pp. 1680-1690.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The earliest stage in bacterial cell division is the formation of a ring, composed of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ, at the division site. Tight spatial and temporal regulation of Z-ring formation is required to ensure that division occurs precisely at midcell between two replicated chromosomes. However, the mechanism of Z-ring formation and its regulation in vivo remain unresolved. Here we identify the defect of an interesting temperature-sensitive ftsZ mutant (ts1) of Bacillus subtilis. At the nonpermissive temperature, the mutant protein, FtsZ(Ts1), assembles into spiral-like structures between chromosomes. When shifted back down to the permissive temperature, functional Z rings form and division resumes. Our observations support a model in which Z-ring formation at the division site arises from reorganization of a long cytoskeletal spiral form of FtsZ and suggest that the FtsZ(Ts1) protein is captured as a shorter spiral-forming intermediate that is unable to complete this reorganization step. The ts1 mutant is likely to be very valuable in revealing how FtsZ assembles into a ring and how this occurs precisely at the division site. Copyright &&copy;2006, American Society for Microbiology.

Intriguingly, although the cell division protein DivIB is not required for vegetative division at low temperatures, it is essential for efficient sporulation under these conditions. We show here that at low temperatures in the absence of DivIB, formation of the polar septum during sporulation is delayed and less efficient. Furthermore, the polar septa that are complete are abnormally thick, containing more peptidoglycan than a normal polar septum. These results show that DivIB is specifically required for the efficient and correct formation of a polar septum. This suggests that DivIB is required for the modification of sporulation septal peptidoglycan, raising the possibility that DivIB either regulates hydrolysis of polar septal peptidoglycan or is a hydrolase itself. We also show that, despite the significant number of completed polar septa that form in this mutant, it is unable to undergo engulfment. Instead, hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan within the polar septum, which occurs during the early stages of engulfment, is incomplete, producing a similar phenotype to that of mutants defective in the production of sporulation-specific septal peptidoglycan hydrolases. We propose a role for DivIB in sporulation-specific peptidoglycan remodelling or its regulation during polar septation and engulfment. Copyright &&copy;2006, American Society for Microbiology.

The efficiency of the protocol is demonstrated with extracts of bacteria, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, fungus, Trichoderma harzianum and yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also demonstrate using a membrane centrifugal filtration, that large acidic molecules in excess of 100 kDa, probably including cell wall material, are responsible for the separation difficulties. A range of acidic extraction conditions were investigated, and it was found that optimal extraction is achieved using an extraction solution acidified to pH 3 by 80 mM citric acid. These findings have significant implications for the proteomic study of many medically, agriculturally and environmentally significant microorganisms, as the cell walls of these organisms are often considerably more complex than many commonly studied laboratory strains. &&copy;2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To accommodate the complexity and dynamic nature of any proteome, researchers must use a combination of disparate protein biochemistry techniques, often a highly involved and time-consuming process. Whilst highly sophisticated, individual technologies for each step in studying a proteome are available, true high-throughput proteomics that provides a high degree of reproducibility and sensitivity has been difficult to achieve. The development of high-throughput proteomic platforms, encompassing all aspects of proteome analysis and integrated with genomics and bioinformatics technology, therefore represents a crucial step for the advancement of proteomics research. ProteomIQ;8482# (Proteome Systems) is the first fully integrated, start-to-finish proteomics platform to enter the market. Sample preparation and tracking, centralized data acquisition and instrument control, and direct interfacing with genomics and bioinformatics databases are combined into a single suite of integrated hardware and software tools, facilitating high reproducibility and rapid turnaround times. This review will highlight some features of ProteomIQ, with particular emphasis on the analysis of proteins separated by 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. &&copy;2005 Future Drugs Ltd.;Jensen, S.O., Thompson, L.S. & Harry, E.J. 2005, 'Cell division in Bacillus subtilis: FtsZ and FtsA association is Z-ring independent, and FtsA is required for efficient midcell Z-ring assembly', Journal of Bacteriology, vol. 187, no. 18, pp. 6536-6544.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The earliest stage in cell division in bacteria is the assembly of a Z ring at the division site at midcell. Other division proteins are also recruited to this site to orchestrate the septation process. FtsA is a cytosolic division protein that interacts directly with FtsZ. Its function remains unknown. It is generally believed that FtsA localization to the division site occurs immediately after Z-ring formation or concomitantly with it and that FtsA is responsible for recruiting the later-assembling membrane-bound division proteins to the division site. Here, we report the development of an in vivo chemical cross-linking assay to examine the association between FtsZ and FtsA in Bacillus subtilis cells. We subsequently use this assay in a synchronous cell cycle to show that these two proteins can interact prior to Z-ring formation. We further show that in a B. subtilis strain containing an ftsA deletion, FtsZ localized at regular intervals along the filament but the majority of Z rings were abnormal. FtsA in this organism is therefore critical for the efficient formation of functional Z rings. This is the first report of abnormal Z-ring formation resulting from the loss of a single septation protein. These results suggest that in this organism, and perhaps others, FtsA ensures recruitment of the membrane-bound division proteins by ensuring correct formation of the Z ring.

Spo0A then drives the switch in the site of division septum formation from midcell to a polar position. Activated Spo0A is required for the transcription of key sporulation loci such as spollG, which are negatively regulated by the Soj protein. The transcriptional repressing activity of Soj is antagonized by Spo0J, and both proteins belong to the well-conserved Par family of partitioning proteins. Soj has been shown to jump from nucleoid to nucleoid via the cell pole. The dynamic behaviour of Soj is somehow controlled by Spo0J, which prevents the static association of Soj with the nucleoid, and presumably its transcriptional repression activity. Soj in turn is required for the proper condensation of Spo0J foci around the oriC region. The asymmetric partitioning of the sporangial cell requires DivIB and other proteins involved in vegetative (medial) division. We describe an allele of the cell division gene divIB (divIB80) that reduces the cellular levels of DivIB, and affects nucleoid structure and segregation in growing cells, yet has no major impact on cell division. In divIB80 cells Spo0J foci are not correctly condensed and Soj associates statically with the nucleoid. The divIB80 allele prevents transcription of spollG, and arrests sporulation prior to the formation of the asymmetric division septum. The defect in Spo0A-dependent gene expression, and the Spo- phenotype can be suppressed by expression of divIB in trans or by deletion of the soj-spo0J locus. However, deletion of the spo0J-soj region does not restore the normal cellular levels of DivIB. Therefore, the reduced levels of DivIB in the divIB80 mutant are sufficient for efficient cell division, but not to sustain a second, earlier function of DivIB related to the activity of the Spo0J/Soj system of chromosome segregation.;Migocki, M.D., Lewis, P.J., Wake, R.G. & Harry, E.J. 2004, 'The midcell replication factory in Bacillus subtilis is highly mobile: Implications for coordinating chromosome replication with other cell cycle events', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 54, no. 2, pp. 452-463.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;During vegetative growth, rod-shaped bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis divide precisely at midcell. It is the Z ring that defines the position of the division site. We previously demonstrated that the early stages of chromosome replication are linked to midcell Z ring assembly in B. subtilis and proposed a direct role for the centrally located replication factory in masking and subsequently unmasking the midcell site for Z ring assembly. We now show that the replication factory is significantly more scattered about the cell centre than the Z ring in both vegetative cells and outgrown spores of B. subtilis. This finding is inconsistent with the midcell replication factory acting as a direct physical block to Z ring assembly. Time-lapse experiments demonstrated that the lower precision of replication factory positioning results from its high mobility around the cell centre. Various aspects of this mobility are presented and the results are discussed in the light of current views on the determinants of positional information required for accurate chromosome segregation and cell division.;Harry, E.J. & Lewis, P.J. 2003, 'Early targeting of Min proteins to the cell poles in germinated spores of Bacillus subtilis: Evidence for division apparatus-independent recruitment of Min proteins to the division site', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 47, no. 1, pp. 37-48.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The earliest event in bacterial cell division is the assembly of a tubulin-like protein, FtsZ, at mid-cell to form a ring. In rod-shaped bacteria, the Min system plays an important role in division site placement by inhibiting FtsZ ring formation specifically at the polar regions of the cell. The Min system comprises MinD and MinC, which form an inhibitor complex and, in Bacillus subtilis, DivIVA, which ensures that division is inhibited only in the polar regions. All three proteins localize to the division site at mid-cell and to cell poles. Their recruitment to the division site is dependent on localization of both 'early' and 'late' division proteins. We have examined the temporal and spatial localization of DivIVA relative to that of FtsZ during the first and second cell division after germination and outgrowth of B. subtilis spores. We show that, although the FtsZ ring assembles at mid-cell about halfway through the cell cycle, DivIVA assembles at this site immediately before cell division and persists there during Z-ring constriction and completion of division. We also show that both DivIVA and MinD localize to the cell poles immediately upon spore germination, well before a Z ring forms at mid-cell. Furthermore, these proteins were found to be present in mature, dormant spores. These results suggest that targeting of Min proteins to division sites does not depend directly on the assembly of the division apparatus, as suggested previously, and that potential polar division sites are blocked at the earliest possible stage in the cell cycle in germinated spores as a mechanism to ensure that equal-sized daughter cells are produced upon cell division.;Ogura, Y., Ogasawara, N., Harry, E.J. & Moriya, S. 2003, 'Increasing the Ratio of Soj to Spo0J Promotes Replication Initiation in Bacillus subtilis', Journal of Bacteriology, vol. 185, no. 21, pp. 6316-6324.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The ParA and ParB protein families are well conserved in bacteria. However, their functions are still unclear. In Bacillus subtilis, Soj and Spo0J are members of these two protein families, respectively. A previous report revealed that replication initiated early and asynchronously in spo0J null mutant cells, as determined by flow cytometry. In this study, we examined the cause of this promotion of replication initiation. Deletion of both the soj and spo0J genes restored the frequency of replication initiation to almost the wild-type level, suggesting that production of Soj in the absence of Spo0J leads to early and asynchronous initiation of replication. Consistent with this suggestion, overproduction of Soj in wild-type cells had the same effect on replication initiation as in the spo0J null mutant, and overproduction of both Soj and Spo0J did not. These results indicate that when the ratio of Soj to Spo0J increases, Soj interferes with tight control of replication initiation and causes early and asynchronous initiation. Whereas replication initiation also occurred significantly earlier in the two spo0J mutants, spo0J14 and spo0J17, it occurred only slightly early in the sojK16Q mutant and was delayed in the sojG12V mutant. Although Soj localized to nucleoids in the spo0J mutants, the two Soj mutant proteins were distributed throughout the cell or localized to cell poles. Thus, interestingly, the promotion of replication initiation seems to correlate with localization of Soj to nucleoids. This may suggest that Soj inhibits transcription of some cell cycle genes and leads to early and asynchronous initiation of replication. In wild-type cells Spo0J counteracts this Soj function.;Harry, L. 2003, 'The precision of bacterial cell division', Today's Life Science, vol. 15, no. 2, pp. 34-37.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Migocki, M. & Harry, L. 2003, 'Splitting up: a time and place for it in bacteria', Australian Biochemist, vol.

FtsL and DivIC are essential components of this division machinery in Bacillus subtilis. We used yeast two-hybrid analysis as well as a variety of biochemical and biophysical methods to examine the proposed interaction between Bacillus subtilis FtsL and DivIC. We show that FtsL and DivIC are thermodynamically unstable proteins that are likely to be unfolded and therefore targeted for degradation unless stabilized by interactions with other components of the septasome. However, we show that this stabilization does not result from a direct interaction between FtsL and DivIC. We propose that the observed interdependence of DivIC and FtsL stability is a result of indirect interactions that are mediated by other septasomal proteins.;Migocki, M.D., Freeman, M.K., Wake, R.G. & Harry, E.J. 2002, 'The Min system is not required for precise placement of the midcell Z ring in Bacillus subtilis', EMBO Reports, vol. 3, no. 12, pp. 1163-1167.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;In bacteria, the Min system plays a role in positioning the midcell division site by inhibiting the formation of the earliest precursor of cell division, the Z ring, at the cell poles. However, whether the Min system also contributes to establishing the precise placement of the midcell Z ring is unresolved. We show that the Z ring is positioned at midcell with a high degree of precision in Bacillus subtilis, and this is completely maintained in the absence of the Min system. Min is therefore not required for correct midcell Z ring placement in B. subtilis. Our results strongly support the idea that the primary role of the Min system is to block Z ring formation at the cell poles and that a separate mechanism must exist to ensure cell division occurs precisely at midcell.;Harry, E.J. 2001, 'Bacterial cell division: Regulating Z-ring formation', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 40, no. 4, pp. 795-803.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The earliest stage of cell division in bacteria is the formation of a Z ring, composed of a polymer of the FtsZ protein, at the division site. Z rings appear to be synthesized in a bi-directional manner from a nucleation site (NS) located on the inside of the cytoplasmic membrane. It is the utilization of a NS specifically at the site of septum formation that determines where and when division will occur. However, a Z ring can be made to form at positions other than at the division site. How does a cell regulate utilization of a NS at the correct location and at the right time? In rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, two factors involved in this regulation are the Min system and nucleoid occlusion. It is suggested that in B. subtilis, the main role of the Min proteins is to inhibit division at the nucleoid-free cell poles. In E. coli it is currently not clear whether the Min system can direct a Z ring to the division site at mid-cell or whether its main role is to ensure that division inhibition occurs away from mid-cell, a role analogous to that in B. subtilis. While the nucleoid negatively influences Z-ring formation in its vicinity in these rod-shaped organisms, the exact relationship between nucleoid occlusion and the ability to form a mid-cell Z ring is unresolved. Recent evidence suggests that in B. subtilis and Caulobacter crescentus, utilization of the NS at the division site is intimately linked to the progress of a round of chromosome replication and this may form the basis of achieving co-ordination between chromosome replication and cell division.;Harry, E.J. 2001, 'Coordinating DNA replication with cell division: Lessons from outgrowing spores', Biochimie, vol. 83, no. 1, pp. 75-81.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Progress in solving the long-standing puzzle of how a cell coordinates chromosome replication with cell division is significantly aided by the use of synchronous cell populations. Currently three systems are employed for obtaining such populations: the Escherichia coli 'baby machine', the developmentally-controlled cell cycle of Caulobacter crescentus, and Bacillus subtilis germinated and outgrowing spores. This review examines our current understanding of the relationship between replication and division and how the use of B. subtilis outgrowing spores and, more recently its combination with immunofluorescence microscopy, has contributed significantly to this important area of biology. About 20 years ago, and also more recently, this system was used to show convincingly that termination of DNA replication is not essential for a central septum to form, raising the possibility that the early stages of division occur well before termination. It has also been demonstrated that there is no major synthesis of the division initiation proteins, FtsZ and DivIB, linked to initiation, progression or completion of the first round of chromosome replication accompanying spore outgrowth. This has led to the suggestion that the primary link between chromosome replication and cell division at midcell is not likely to occur through a control over the levels of these proteins. Very recent work has employed a combination of the use of B. subtilis outgrowing spores with immunofluorescence microscopy to investigate the relationship between midcell Z ring assembly and the round of chromosome replication linked to it. The results of this work suggest a role for initiation and progression into the round of replication in blocking midcell Z ring formation until the round is complete or almost complete, thereby ensuring that cell division occurs between two equally-partitioned chromosomes. &&copy;2001 Soci&&eacute;t&&eacute;franaise de biochimie et biologie mol&&eacute;culaire / &&Eacute;ditions scientifiques et m&&eacute;dicales...;Daniel, R.A., Harry, E.J. & Errington, J. 2000, 'Role of penicillin-binding protein PBP 2B in assembly and functioning of the division machinery of Bacillus subtilis', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 35, no. 2, pp. 299-311.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;We have characterized the role of the penicillin-binding protein PBP 2B in cell division of Bacillus subtilis. We have shown that depletion of the protein results in an arrest in division, but that this arrest is slow, probably because the protein is relatively stable. PBP as-depleted filaments contained, at about their mid-points, structures resembling partially formed septa, into which most, if not all, of the division proteins had assembled. Although clearly deficient in wall material, membrane invagination seemed to continue, indicating that membrane and wall ingrowth can be uncoupled. At other potential division sites along the filaments, no visible ingrowths were observed, although FtsZ rings assembled at regular intervals. Thus, PBP 2B is apparently required for both the initiation of division and continued septal ingrowth. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the protein is recruited to the division site. The pattern of localization suggested that this recruitment occurs continually during septal ingrowth. During sporulation, PBP 2B was present transiently in the asymmetrical septum of sporulating cells, and its availability may play a role in the regulation of sporulation septation.;Regamey, A., Harry, E.J. & Wake, R.G. 2000, 'Mid-cell Z ring assembly in the absence of entry into the elongation phase of the round of replication in bacteria: Co-ordinating chromosome replication with cell division', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 423-434.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;We have shown previously that, when spores of a thymine-requiring strain of Bacillus subtilis were grown out in the absence of thymine, mid-cell Z rings formed over the nucleoid and much earlier than might be expected with respect to progression into the round of replication. It is now shown that such conditions allow no replication of oriC. Rather than replication, partial degradation of the oriC region occurs, suggesting that the status of this region is connected with the 'premature' mid-cell Z ring assembly. A correlation was observed between entry into the replication elongation phase and a block to mid-cell Z rings. The conformation of the nucleoid under various conditions of DNA replication inhibition or limitation suggests that relief of nucleoid occlusion is not primarily responsible for mid-cell Z ring formation in the absence of thymine. We propose the existence of a specific structure at mid-cell that defines the Z ring nucleation site (NS). It is suggested that this NS is normally masked by the replisome upon initiation of replication or soon after entry into the elongation phase, and subsequently unmasked relatively late in the round. During spore outgrowth in the absence of thymine, this checkpoint control over mid-cell Z ring assembly breaks down prematurely.;Katis, V.L., Wake, R.G. & Harry, E.J. 2000, 'Septal localization of the membrane-bound division proteins of Bacillus subtilis DivIB and DivIC is codependent only at high temperatures and requires FtsZ', Journal of Bacteriology, vol. 182, no. 12, pp. 3607-3611.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we have examined the dependency of localization among three Bacillus subtilis division proteins, FtsZ, DivIB, and DivIC, to the division site. DivIC is required for DivIB localization. However, DivIC localization is dependent on DivIB only at high growth temperatures, at which DivIB is essential for division. FtsZ localization is required for septal recruitment of DivIB and DivIC, but FtsZ can be recruited independently of DivIB. These localization studies suggest a more specific role for DivIB in division, involving interaction with DivIC.;Harry, E.J., Rodwell, J. & Wake, R.G. 1999, 'Co-ordinating DNA replication with cell division in bacteria: A link between the early stages of a round of replication and mid-cell Z ring assembly', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 33, no. 1, pp. 33-40.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Spores of a thymine-requiring strain of Bacillus subtilis 168, which is also temperature sensitive for the initiation of chromosome replication, were germinated and allowed to grow out at the permissive temperature in a minimal medium containing no added thymine. Under these conditions, there was no or very limited progression into the elongation phase of the first round of replication. In a significant proportion of the outgrown cells, a Z ring formed precisely at mid-cell and over the centrally positioned nucleoid, leading eventually to the formation of a mature division septum. When initiation of the first round of replication was blocked through a temperature shift and with thymine present, the Z ring was positioned acentrally. The central Z ring that formed in the absence of thymine was blocked by the presence of a DNA polymerase III inhibitor. It is concluded that the very early stages of a round of replication (initiation plus possibly limited progression into the elongation phase) play a key role in the precise positioning of the Z ring at mid-cell and between replicating daughter chromosomes.;Daniel, R.A., Harry, E.J., Katis, V.L., Wake, R.G. & Errington, J. 1998, 'Characterization of the essential cell division gene ftsL(yIID) of Bacillus subtilis and its role in the assembly of the division apparatus', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 29, no. 2, pp. 593-604.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;We have identified the Bacillus subtilis homologue of the essential cell division gene, ftsL, of Escherichia coli. Repression of ftsL in a strain engineered to carry a conditional promoter results in cell filamentation, with a near immediate arrest of cell division. The filaments show no sign of invagination, indicating that division is blocked at an early stage. FtsL is also shown to be required for septation during sporulation, and depletion of FtsL blocks the activation but not the synthesis of the prespore-specific sigma factor,?(F). Immunofluorescence microscopy shows that depletion of FtsL has little or no effect on FtsZ ring formation, but the assembly of other division proteins, DivlB and DivlC, at the site of division is prevented. Repression of FtsL also results in a rapid loss of DivlC protein, indicating that DivlC stability is dependent on the presence of FtsL, in turn suggesting that FtsL is intrinsically unstable. The instability of one or more components of the division apparatus may be important for the cyclic assembly/disassembly of the division apparatus.;Katis, V.L., Harry, E.J. & Wake, R.G. 1997, 'The Bacillus subtilis division protein DivlC is a highly abundant membrane-bound protein that localizes to the division site', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 26, no. 5, pp. 1047-1055.;The Bacillus subtilis divlC gene is involved in the initiation of cell division. It encodes a 14.7 kDa protein, with a potential transmembrane region near the N-terminus. In this paper, we show that DivlC is associated with the cell membrane and, in conjunction with previously published sequence data, conclude that it is oriented such that its small N-terminus is within the cytoplasm and its larger C-terminus is external to the cytoplasm. DivlC is shown to be a highly abundant division protein, present at approximately 50 000 molecules per cell. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, DivlC was seen to localize at the division site of rapidly dividing cells between well-segregated nucleoids. Various DivlC immunostaining patterns were observed, and these correlated with different cell lengths, suggesting that the DivlC localization takes on various forms during the cell cycle. The DivlC immunolocalization patterns are very similar to those of another membrane-bound B. subtilis division protein, DivlB.;Harry, E.J. & Wake, R.G. 1997, 'The membrane-bound cell division protein DivIB is localized to the division site in Bacillus subtilis', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 25, no. 2, pp. 275-283.;The cell division gene divIB of Bacillus subtilis is essential for the normal rate of growth and division. The gene product, DivIB, is a membrane- bound protein in which the bulk of the protein (at the C-terminal end) is on the exterior surface of the cell membrane. DivIB is involved the early stages of septum formation, but its exact role in cell division is unknown. To gain more information about the mode of action of DivIB in septum formation, we determined the location of DivIB within the cell membrane using immunofluorescence. This immunolocalization approach established that DivIB becomes localized to the division site before visible septation and remains localized to this site throughout the division process. Various DivIB immunostaining patterns were observed in immunofluorescence experiments and, together with cell length and nucleoid distance measurements, have allowed us to propose two models to describe DivIB localization during the cell cycle.;Harry, E.J. 1997, 'Illuminating the force: Bacterial mitosis?', Trends in Microbiology, vol. 5, no. 8, pp. 295-297.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Harry, E.J., Pogliano, K. & Losick, R. 1995, 'Use of immunofluorescence to visualize cell-specific gene expression during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis', Journal of Bacteriology, vol. 177, no. 12, pp. 3386-3393.;We have adapted immunofluorescence microscopy for use in Bacillus subtilis and have employed this procedure for visualizing cell-specific gene expression at early to intermediate stages of sporulation. Sporangia were doubly stained with propidium iodide to visualize the forespore and mother cell nucleoids and with fluorescein-conjugated antibodies to visualize the location of?-galactosidase produced under the control of the sporulation RNA polymerase sigma factors?(E) and?(F). In confirmation and extension of earlier reports, we found that expression of a lacZ fusion under the control of?(E) was confined to the mother cell compartment of sporangia at the septation (II) and engulfment (III) stages of morphogenesis. Conversely,?(F)-directed gene expression was confined to the forespore compartment of sporangia at postseptation stages of development. Little indication was found for?(E)- or?(F)-directed gene expression prior to septation or in both compartments of postseptation sporangia. Gene expression under the control of the forespore sigma factor?(G) also exhibited a high level of compartmentalization. A high proportion of sporangia exhibited fluorescence in our immunostaining protocol, which should be suitable for the subcellular localization of sporulation proteins for which specific antibodies are available.;Hofmeister, A.E.M., Londono-Vallejo, A., Harry, E., Stragier, P. & Losick, R. 1995, 'Extracellular signal protein triggering the proteolytic activation of a developmental transcription factor in B. subtilis', Cell, vol. 83, no. 2, pp. 219-226.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;We present biochemical evidence for an intercellular signal transduction pathway in B. subtilis. This pathway governs the conversion of the proprotein pro-?E to the mature transcription factor?E. Proteolytic processing is mediated by the membrane protein SpoIIGA and is triggered by the inferred extracellular signal protein SpoIIR. A factor in conditioned medium from B. subtilis cells engineered to produce SpoIIR during growth triggered processing in protoplasts of B. subtilis cells that had been engineered to produce SpoIIGA and pro-?E The factor was also detected in, and partially purified from, extracts of SpoIIR-producing cells of E. coli. We speculate that SpoIIGA is both a receptor and a protease and that SpoIIR interacts with SpolIGA on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane, activating the intracellular protease domain of SpolIGA. &&copy;1995.;Pogliano, K., Harry, E. & Losick, R. 1995, 'Visualization of the subcellular location of sporulation proteins in Bacillus subtilis using immunofluorescence microscopy', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 18, no. 3, pp. 459-470.;We describe the application of immunofluorescence microscopy to visualization of the subcellular localization of proteins involved in coat morphogenesis and chromosome packaging during the process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. In confirmation and extension of previous findings, we show that SpoIVA, which is responsible for guiding coat formation to the surface of the outer membrane that surrounds the developing spore, assembles into a shell that is located close to or on the surface of this enveloping membrane. CotE, which is responsible for the formation of the outer layer of the coat, assembles into a second shell of apparently larger diameter. Assembly of SpoIVA could be detected as early as the morphological stage of polar septation and closely followed the enveloping membrane of the mother cell during the stage of engulfment, thereby providing a sensitive and diagnostic marker for this phagocytic-like process. Surprisingly, the chromosome of the developing spore and the small, acid-soluble proteins, known as?/?-type SASPs, that are known to coat the spore chromosome, were found to co-localize to a doughnut-like ring of approximately 1?m in diameter. The use of a double mutant lacking the?/?-type SASP demonstrated that these high abundance, DNA-binding proteins are responsible for packaging the chromosome of the developing spore into this unusual structure. We conclude that sporulation in B. subtilis is a fertile system for addressing cell biological problems in a bacterium and that immunofluorescence microscopy provides a sensitive method for visualizing protein subcellular localization at high resolution.;Harry, E.J., Partridge, S.R., Weiss, A.S. & Wake, R.G. 1994, 'Conservation of the 168 divIB gene in Bacillus subtilis W23 and B. licheniformis, and evidence for homology to ftsQ of Escherichia coli', Gene, vol. 147, no. 1, pp. 85-89.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;The chromosomal regions of Bacillus subtilis (Bs) W23 and Bacillus licheniformis (Bl), which span the sequence encoding the homolog of the division initiation gene, divIB, of Bs 168 were cloned and sequenced. The high level of conservation of the amino acid (aa) sequence of the DivIB protein (99 and 68% identity for BsW23 and Bl, respectively) was consistent with a significant role for this protein in the cell cycle of the two species. The hydropathy profile for DivIB of Bl was almost identical to that of Bsl68 and consistent with a membrane location, as previously established for the latter. The higher than average level of identity (87%) of the 31-aa N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of DivIB between Bsl68 and Bl raised the possibility of a special role for this domain. Database analyses using the Bl DivIB sequence and similarity analyses also strongly suggested that DivIB, of Bl and Bs, is a homolog of FtsQ of Escherichia coli. The flanking sequences extending into the unidentified orfs both upstream and downstream from divIB were highly conserved between Bs168 and Bl at both the nucleotide and aa levels. It was confirmed that orf4 of Bs168 is dispensable. &&copy;1994.;Harry, E.J., Rowland, S.L., Malo, M.S. & Wake, R.G. 1994, 'Expression of divIB of Bacillus subtilis during vegetative growth', Journal of Bacteriology, vol. 176, no. 4, pp. 1172-1179.;Expression of the division initiation gene, divIB, of Bacillus subtilis during vegetative growth was examined. lacZ fusion studies and transcription start point mapping have established that a?(A) promoter proximal to divIB is utilized in vivo. The -10 region of this promoter, which is located 93 bp upstream of the start codon, has been defined precisely by site-directed mutagenesis that destroys the promoter. Examination of transcripts by Northern (RNA) blotting has shown that there are at least two transcripts for divIB. The established proximal promoter was found to give rise to a very minor transcript which could not be convincingly demonstrated in wild-type cells but which became apparent upon insertion of a plasmid into the chromosome just upstream of this promoter. The major transcript for divIB originated from a site several kb upstream of the gene and is probably the same as the long polycistronic message also traversing the murD-spoVE-murG genes that was identified previously by others (A. D. Henriques, H. de Lencastre, and P. J. Piggot, Biochimic 74:735-748, 1992). Transcription from the proximal promoter alone, in an upstream-deletion mutant strain, provided sufficient DivIB for normal growth and division as well as sporulation.;Harry, E.J., Stewart, B.J. & Wake, R.G. 1993, 'Characterization of mutations in divIB of Bacillus subtilis and cellular localization of the DivIB protein', Molecular Microbiology, vol. 7, no. 4, pp. 611-621.;Four temperature-sensitive mutations in the divIB gene of Bacillus subtilis have been localized to the region corresponding to the C-terminal half of the 263-residue DivIB protein. Antiserum was raised to the 80% C-terminal portion lying on one side of a putative transmembrane (hydrophobic) segment, and used to examine aspects of the nature and localization of the DivIB protein in the cell. A single DivIB species of a size equal to the full-length protein encoded by the divIB gene was detected in wild-type cells. Cell fractionation studies established that DivIB is associated preferentially with the cell envelope (membrane plus cell wall), with approximately 50% being released into solution upon treatment of cells with lysozyme under conditions that yield protoplasts. Of the remaining 50%, approximately half remained firmly associated with the membrane fraction. On the basis of the 'positive-inside rule' of von Heijne (1986) it is suggested that the topology of membrane-bound DivIB is such that the long C-terminal portion is directed to the outside and the smaller N-terminal portion to the inside of the cell. DivIB in protoplasts was rapidly degraded by proteinase K under conditions where there was no general proteolysis of the cytoplasmic proteins. This is consistent with its absence from the cytoplasm, and with the predicted membrane topology. Septum positioning in a divIB null mutant, which grows as filaments at temperatures of 30&&deg;C and below, was found to be normal. It appears that DivIB is needed for achieving the appropriate rate of initiation of septum formation at normal division sites. It is proposed that the C-terminal portion of DivIB, localized on the exterior surface of the membrane and in juxtaposition to the peptidoglycan, normally interacts with another protein (or proteins) to initiate septum formation.;Harry, E.J. & Wake, R.G. 1989, 'Cloning and expression of a Bacillus subtilis division initiation gene for which a homolog has not been identified in another organism', Journal of Bacteriology, vol. 171, no. 12, pp. 6835-6839.;The Bacillus subtilis 168 division initiation genes defined by the temperature-sensitive mutations ts-1 and ts-12 were cloned into a 10.5-kilobase EcoRI fragment of DNA in the lambda EMBL4 vector. The two genes were separated by approximately 3 kilobases. The gene in which the ts-1 mutation resides was shown to be the same as the B. subtilis homolog of the Escherichia coli ftsZ gene. The other gene was named divIB. It showed no homology to any previously identified gene and coded for a protein of 30.1 kilodaltons which was probably membrane bound.;Selected Peer-Assessed Projects;Identifying how bacterial cells find their middle: a new perspective;Targeting nucleic acid synthesis and cell division in gram-negative bacterial pathogens;Investigating the Ability of Honey to Inhibit Bacterial Biofilms Found in Chronic Wounds;Bacterial filamentation as a survival strategy: a goldmine for the discovery of new cell division regulators;Bacterial Cell Biology: Investigating an Optical Revolution;Nucleic Acid Synthesis and Cell Division in Model Pathogenic Bacteria;Establishing how bacterial cells position the division site;Bacterial Proteomics: From Cell Division to Novel Antibiotic Targets;Bacterial cell division: discovering how it begins and the network of protein interactions it requires;Investigating a novel mechanism for controlling multiplication of bacteria- Scientific Visits to Japan 2011;Pages;1;2;next ›;last »;about uts;The University;Facilities and maps;UTS governance;Faculties;Privacy statement;Disclaimer",

With higher Indium concentration the quantum efficiency decreases, which is thought to be due to increasing inhomogeneity. In this work it is shown that the growth of InGaN on misorientated GaN substrates forces these Indium fluctuations on a nanometre scale. Temperature dependent luminescence measurements provide information about the homogeneity of the band structure. Energy selective excitation confirms the existence of localisation centres and indicates their energetic depth. Time-resolved measurements define the lifetime of localized excitons, which provides information about radiative and nonradiative processes as well as tunnelling mechanisms between the localization centres. Indium fluctuations at the nm and?m scale are measured using cathodoluminescence (CL) and Micro Photoluminescence (?PL) respectively. &&copy;2010 IEEE.;Foley, M., Ton-That, C. & Phillips, M.R. 2010, 'Cathodoluminescence characterisation of vapour transport grown ZnO structures', ICONN 2010 - Proceedings of the 2010 International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, pp. 207-209.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;ZnO structures grown under controlled vapour-phase transport growth conditions were characterised by electron microscopy and high-resolution cathodoluminescence techniques. Variations in the defect related emission and morphology were observed to be dependent on the distance from the source material. Annealing of grown structures under oxygen eliminated the defect emission. These experimental observations suggest that oxygen deficiency in ZnO is linked to the defect related emission, and that defect emission is strongly influenced by the oxygen gas content during vapour transport growth. &&copy;2010 IEEE.;Dowd, A.R., Armstrong, N.G., Ton-That, C., Johansson, B. & Phillips, M. 2008, 'Cathodoluminescence for High Resolution Non-Destructive Luminescence Depth Profiling.', IUMRS-ICEM 2008 | COMMAD 2008, A-MRS, Sydney, Australia.;Coleman, V.A., Bradby, J.E., Jagadish, C. & Phillips, M.R. 2007, 'A comparison of the mechanical properties and the impact of contact induced damage in a- and c- axis ZnO single crystals', Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings, pp. 213-218.;Nanoindentation studies were conducted on a-axis oriented ZnO single crystals. The mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms were monitored and compared to previously determined data from c-axis material. Hardness and modulus values reveal that a-axis ZnO is significantly softer than c-axis material (hardness of 2 &&plusmn;0.2 GPa), and behaves more plastically. Additionally, the influence of contact induced damage on the defect structure of a-axis material was examined using cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and monochromatic imaging to monitor the luminescence from indent sites. Deformation directly under the indent site enhanced the occurrence of red luminescence, and was attributed to a native defect in ZnO that has a higher formation energy than the defects responsible for the green and yellow visible defect bands, which were present in ZnO during growth and clustered to the indent site during annealing. &&copy;2007 Materials Research Society.;Mnlguth, E., Hoffmann, A., Phillips, M. & Gehlhoff, W. 2006, 'Fe-centers in GaN as candidates for spintronics applications', Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings, pp. 131-136.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;The potential use of Fe doped GaN for spintronics applications requires a complete understanding of the electronic structure of Fe in all of its charge states.

The CL intensity distribution is formulated as a linear inverse problem and two methods namely the r&&eacute;gularisation method and maximum entropy method can be applied to determine the depth profile without making any assumptions concerning the profile function, i.e. a free form solution.

Ion implantation is widely used in the microelectronics industry for selective area doping and device isolation. Understanding damage accumulation and recrystallization processes is important for achieving selective area doping. In this study, As (potential p-type dopant) ion implantation and annealing studies were carried out. ZnO samples were implanted with high dose (1.4 1017 ions/cm2) 300 keV As ions at room temperature.

The intensity of the ZnO near band edge peak was significantly increased after heat treatment in hydrogen. Conversely, thermal annealing in the other gas types decreased this emission. This effect is attributed to hydrogen passivation of competitive non-radiative defect centers, most likely bulk zinc vacancy centers. The appearance of a strong green emission centered at 2.4 eV following thermal annealing in all gas atmospheres is ascribed to the formation of bulk oxygen vacancy defects. A strong red shift of the near band edge emission with increasing beam current at 300 K is accredited to electron beam heating rather than to an increase in the carrier density. Electron beam heating is evidenced by the occurrence of a strong black body emission in the near infrared spectral region. &&copy;2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We demonstrate possibility of in-depth profiling of complicated multi quantum well structures, which allows us to evaluate light emission characteristics from different regions of, e.g., laser structures. Due to this property of the CL, we can evaluate interconnections between structural quality of the samples and light emission characteristics. Stimulated emission under electron beam pumping is achieved in a conventional CL set up for selected heterostructures. Threshold currents for stimulated emission are evaluated from the CL investigations. We demonstrate that potential fluctuations are not fully screened in the active regions of laser structures, even at large excitation densities.;Gelhausen, O., Malguth, E., Phillips, M.R., Goldys, E.M., Strassburg, M., Hoffmann, A., Graf, T., Gjukic, M. & Stutzmann, M. 2003, 'Optical properties of Mn-doped GaN', Materials Research Society Symposium - Proceedings, pp. 569-574.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Molecular beam epitaxy-grown GaN with different Mn concentrations (5-231019 cm-3) and codoped with Si were investigated by cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy and optical transmission measurements. In the GaN:Mn, an intense absorption peak at 1.414 +/- 0.002 eV was observed. This peak was attributed to an internal 5T 2? 5E transition of the deep neutral Mn3+ state since its intensity scaled with the Mn3+ concentration. The CL measurements showed that Mn-doping concentrations around 1020 cm -3 had three effects on the emission spectrum: (i) the donor bound exciton at 3.460 eV was reduced by more than one order of magnitude, (ii) the donor-acceptor-pair band at 3.27 eV was completely quenched and (iii) the yellow luminescence centered at 2.2 eV was the strongly decreased. The latter two effects were attributed to a reduced concentration of VGa. In the infrared spectral range, three broad, Mn-doping related CL emission bands centered at 1.01 &&plusmn;0.02 eV, 1.09 &&plusmn;0.02 eV and 1.25 &&plusmn;0.03 eV were observed. These bands might be related to deep donor complexes, which are generated as a result of the heavy Mn-doping, rather than internal transitions at the Mn atom.;Gelhausen, O., Phillips, M.R., Goldys, E.M., Paskova, T., Monemar, B., Strassburg, M. & Hoffmann, A. 2003, 'Formation and dissociation of hydrogen-related defect centers in Mg-doped GaN', Materials Research Society Symposium - Proceedings, pp. 497-502.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Moderately and heavily Mg-doped GaN were studied by a combination of post-growth annealing processes and electron beam irradiation techniques during cathodoluminescence (CL) to elucidate the chemical origin of the recombination centers responsible for the main optical emission lines. The shallow donor at 20-30 meV below the conduction band, which is involved in the donor-acceptor-pair (DAP) emission at 3.27 eV, was attributed to a hydrogen-related center, presumably a (VN-H) complex. Due to the small dissociation energy (2 eV) of the (VNH) complex, this emission line was strongly reduced by low-energy electron irradiation. CL investigations of the DAP at a similar energetic position in Si-doped (n-type) GaN indicated that this emission line is of different chemical origin than the 3.27 eV DAP in Mg-doped GaN. A slightly deeper DAP emission centered at 3.14 eV was observed following low-energy electron irradiation, indicating the appearance of an additional donor level with a binding energy of 100-200 meV, which was tentatively attributed to a VN-related center. The blue band (2.8-3.0 eV) in heavily Mg-doped GaN was found to consist of at least two different deep donor levels at 350&&plusmn;30 meV and 440&&plusmn;40 meV.

Due to the dissociation of (Mg-H)0 complexes, LEEBI significantly increases the (e,Mg0) emission (3.26 eV) at 300 K and substantially decreases the H-Mg donor-acceptor-pair (DAP) emission (3.27 eV) at 80 K. In-plane and depth-resolved CL imaging indicates that hydrogen dissociation results from electron-hole recombination at H-defect complexes rather than heating by the electron beam. The dissociated hydrogen atoms associate with nitrogen vacancies, forming a deeper donor, i.e. a (H-VN) complex. The corresponding deeper DAP emission with Mg centered at 3.1 eV is clearly observed between 160 and 220 K. Moreover, a broad yellow luminescence (YL) band centered at 2.2 eV is observed in MOVPE-grown Mg-doped GaN after LEEBI-treatment. It is suggested that a combination of LEEBI-induced Fermi-level downshift due to Mg-acceptor activation and simultaneous dissociation of gallium vacancy-impurity complexes, i.e. (VGa-H), is responsible for the observed YL.;Aubin, A.S., Drouin, D. & Phillips, M.R. 2002, 'ESEM beam current measuring device based on a planar Schottky Diode', Microscopy and Microanalysis, pp. 1538-1539.;Rémond, G., Fialin, M., Nockolds, C.E., Phillips, M.R. & Roques-Carmes, C. 2002, 'Absorption correction of Fe La,? emission from iron oxides', Microscopy and Microanalysis, pp. 1496-1497.;Godlewski, M., Ivanov, V., Khachapuridze, A., Narkowicz, R. & Phillips, M. 2001, 'Effects of Localisations in CdTe-Based Quantum Well Structures in optical Organic and Inorganic Materials', Proceedings of the SPIE, SPIE, SPIE, Lithuania, pp. 86-91.;Phillips, M., Griffin, B., Drouin, D., Nockolds, C. & Remond, G. 2001, 'X-Ray Micronalaysis in the Environmentl SEM Using Mapping and Fourier Deconvolution Techniques', Microscopy & Microanalysis 2001 Proceedings Volume 7 Supplement 2, Microscopy & Microanalysis 2001, Springer Verlag, California, pp. 708-709.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Gross, K.A., Phillips, M.R. & Suetsugu, Y. 2001, 'Cathodoluminescence emission for differentiating the degree of carbonation in apatites', Key Engineering Materials, pp. 179-182.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Cathodoluminescence has recently been used successfully in detecting and determining the spatial location of the amorphous phase in plasma sprayed calcium phosphate coatings.

The structures had strain-free quantum wells and strained barriers. Strong piezoelectric fields in these structures led to a large red shift of the PL emission energies and long decay times were also observed. While the peak energies could be modelled using the effective mass approximation, the calculated free exciton radiative lifetimes were much shorter than those observed in experiments, indicating an alternative recombination mechanism, tentatively attributed to localised excitons. Cathodoluminescence depth profiling revealed an unusually small penetration range of electrons suggesting that electron-hole pairs preferentially remain within the multiple quantum well region due to the existing electric fields. Spatial fluctuations of the cathodoluminescence intensity were also observed.;Kucheyev, S.O., Bradby, J.E., Williams, J.S., Swain, M.V., Toth, M., Phillips, M.R. & Jagadish, C. 2001, 'Mechanical properties of As-grown and ion-beam-modified GaN films', Materials Research Society Symposium - Proceedings, pp. Q5.5.1-Q5.5.6.;The deformation behavior of as-grown and ion-beam-modified wurtzite GaN films is studied by nanoindentation with a spherical indenter. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cathodoluminescence are used to characterize the deformation mode. No systematic dependence of the mechanical properties on the film thickness (at least for thicknesses from 1.8 to 4?m) as well as on doping type is observed. Results strongly suggest that (i) slips is the major contributor to the plastic deformation of crystalline GaN and (ii) slip nucleation (rather than a phase transformation) is responsible for \"pop-in\" events observed during loading. Indentation with an? 4.2?m radius spherical indenter at maximum loads up to 900 mN does not produce any cracking visible by AFM in crystalline GaN. Instead, under such loads, indentation results in a pronounced elevation of the material around the impression. Implantation disorder dramatically changes the deformation behavior of GaN. In particular, implantation-produced defects in crystalline GaN suppress (i) \"pop-in\" events during loading, (ii) slip bands observed by AFM, and (iii) the plastic component of deformation. GaN amorphized by ion bombardment exhibits plastic flow even for very low loads. The values of hardness and elastic modulus of amorphous GaN are dramatically reduced compared to those of as-grown GaN.;Godlewski, M., Ivanov, V.Y., Khachapuridze, A., Narkowicz, R. & Phillips, M.R. 2001, 'Effects of localisation in CdTe-based quantum well structures', Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, pp. 86-91.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;The properties of strongly localised excitons in quantum well structure of CdTe/CdMnTe were observed at low temperature.

A strong surface peak of lattice disorder, in addition to the expected damage peak in the region of the maximum of nuclear energy loss, has been observed for all implant conditions of this study. Capping of GaN with SiOx and SixNy layers prior to implantation does not eliminate surface disordering. This may suggest that nitrogen loss is not the main reason for the observed enhanced surface disorder, but, rather, the GaN surface acts as a strong sink for migrating point defects. However, pronounced loss of N during ion bombardment is observed for high dose implantation when the near-surface region is amorphized. Moreover, after amorphization, annealing at temperatures above about 400 &&deg;C leads to complete decomposition of the near-surface layer.;Toth, M., Fleischer, K. & Phillips, M.R. 1999, 'Electron beam induced impurity electro-migration in unintentionally doped GaN', Materials Research Society Symposium - Proceedings, p.

Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles have recently been identified as a promising candidate for advanced nanophotonics applications and quantum technologies. This work reports the formation of luminescent point defects and describes their photophysical properties. In particular, it is shown using correlative photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy that green luminescence at 2.48 eV and an EPR line at g = 2.00 belong to a surface oxygen vacancy (Vinfo,s/infsup+/sup) center, while a second green emission at 2.28 eV is associated with zinc vacancy (VinfZn/inf) centers. It is established that radiative point defects can be excited in the visible that exhibits nanosecond lifetimes using both above bandgap and sub-bandgap 405 and 532 nm excitation. This work provides important knowledge towards employment of point defects in ZnO in nanophotonics technologies.;Choi, S., Berhane, A.M., Gentle, A., Ton-That, C., Phillips, M.R. & Aharonovich, I. 2015, 'Electroluminescence from Localized Defects in Zinc Oxide: Toward Electrically Driven Single Photon Sources at Room Temperature', ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, vol. 7, no. 10, pp. 5619-5623.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 American Chemical Society. Single photon sources are required for a wide range of applications in quantum information science, quantum cryptography, and quantum communications. However, the majority of room temperature emitters to date are only excited optically, which limits their proper integration into scalable devices. In this work, we overcome this limitation and present room temperature electrically driven light emission from localized defects in zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles and thin films. The devices emit in the red spectral range and show excellent rectifying behavior. The emission is stable over an extensive period of time, providing an important prerequisite for practical devices. Our results open possibilities for building new ZnO-based quantum integrated devices that incorporate solid-state single photon sources for quantum information technologies.

X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopy have been used to investigate the chemical states of nitrogen dopants in ZnO nanowires. It is found that nitrogen exists in multiple states: NinfO/inf,NinfZn/inf, and loosely bound Ninf2/inf molecule. The results establish a direct link between a donor-acceptor pair emission at 3.232 eV and the concentration of loosely bound Ninf2/inf. This work confirms that Ninf2/inf at Zn site is a potential candidate for producing a shallow acceptor state in N-doped ZnO as theoretically predicted by Lambrecht and Boonchun [Phys. Rev. B 87, 195207 (2013)10.1103/PhysRevB.87.195207].

New insights into control of nanowire merging phenomena are demonstrated in the growth of thin ZnO nanowires using monodisperse Au colloidal nanoparticles as a catalyst. Both the nanowire diameter and density were found to be strongly dependent on the density of Au nanoparticles. Structural analysis and spectral cathodoluminescence imaging of the c-plane nanowire cross-sections reveal that the thin isolated nanowires growing from the Au nanoparticles begin to merge and coalesce with neighbouring nanowires to form larger nanowires when their separation reaches a threshold distance. Green luminescence, which originated from the remnants of constituent nanowires before merging, is detected at the core of the fused nanowires. The distribution of nanowire diameters and green emission were found to be strongly dependent on the density of the Au nanoparticles. The merging phenomenon is attributed to electrostatic interactions between the nanowire c-facets during growth and well-described by a cantilever bending model.;Anantachaisilp, S., Smith, S.M., Ton-That, C., Pornsuwan, S., Moon, A.R., Nenstiel, C., Hoffmann, A. & Phillips, M.R. 2015, 'Nature of red luminescence in oxygen treated hydrothermally grown zinc oxide nanorods', Journal of Luminescence, vol. 168, pp. 20-25.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. A strong broad red luminescence (RL) peak centered at 1.69 eV (FWHM=0.57 eV) at 15 K [1.78 eV (FWHM=0.69 eV) at 300 K] is formed in ZnO nanorods hydrothermally grown at low temperature following thermal annealing at 650 &&deg;C for 30 min in an Oinf2/inf gas environment. The optical properties of this peak were comprehensively studied using a range of characterization techniques, including photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. With decreasing temperature the RL peak position red shifted and its FWHM became narrower in accordance with the configuration coordinate model. Using these results, the RL has been assigned to highly lattice coupled VinfZn/inf-related acceptor-like centers. No correlation was found between the observed red luminescence and nitrogen impurities.;Khachadorian, S., Gillen, R., Choi, S., Ton-That, C., Kliem, A., Maultzsch, J., Phillips, M.R. & Hoffmann, A. 2015, 'Effects of annealing on optical and structural properties of zinc oxide nanocrystals', Physica Status Solidi (B) Basic Research, vol. 252, no. 11, pp. 2620-2625.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Co.

The optical and vibrational properties of zinc oxide nanocrystals (ZnO NCs), grown by chemical precipitation method, were investigated following thermal annealing treatments in oxygen, argon, and zinc vapors at temperatures up to 900{ring operator}C. Raman scattering and photoluminescence techniques were utilized to show the effect of temperature annealing in various environments on optical and structural properties of ZnO NCs, referring them to the reduction and increase of certain intrinsic defect concentrations.

The NBE intensity depends linearly on the electron beam excitation as expected for excitonic recombination character. The intensities of the green and yellow bands are highly dependent not only on the excitation density but also on temperature. At high excitation densities ZnO exhibits dominant green emission at room temperature, the intensity of the green band can be further controlled by doping ZnO with hydrogen, which passivates green luminescence centers. Conversely at small excitation densities (0.1 nA) and low temperatures the visible luminescence from ZnO is predominantly yellow due to the abundance of Li in hydrothermal ZnO. The results are explained by differences in the recombination kinetics and the relative concentrations of the green and yellow centers, and illustrate that single-color emission can be achieved in ZnO by adjusting the excitation power and temperature. &&copy;2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

As-grown ZnO displays the expected thermal decay of bound excitons with increasing temperature from 7 K, while we observed an anomalous behaviour of the excitonic emission in H-doped ZnO, in which its intensity increases with increasing temperature in the range 140-300 K. Based on a multitude of optical results, a qualitative model is developed which explains the Y line structural defects, which act as an electron trap with an activation energy of 11 meV, being responsible for the anomalous temperature-dependent cathodoluminescence of H-doped ZnO. &&copy;2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.;Callsen, G., Wagner, M.R., Reparaz, J.S., Nippert, F., Kure, T., Kalinowski, S., Hoffmann, A., Ford, M.J., Phillips, M.R., Dalmau, R.F., Schlesser, R., Collazo, R. & Sitar, Z. 2014, 'Phonon pressure coefficients and deformation potentials of wurtzite AlN determined by uniaxial pressure-dependent Raman measurements', Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, vol. 90, no. 20.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2014 American Physical Society. We studied bulk crystals of wurtzite AlN by means of uniaxial pressure-dependent Raman measurements. As a result, we derive the phonon pressure coefficients and deformation potentials for all zone center optical phonon modes. For the A1 and E1 modes, we further experimentally determined the uniaxial pressure dependence of their longitudinal optical-transverse optical (LO-TO) splittings. Our experimental approach delivers new insight into the large variance among previously reported phonon deformation potentials, which are predominantly based on heteroepitaxial growth of AlN and the ball-on-ring technique. Additionally, the measured phonon pressure coefficients are compared to their theoretical counterparts obtained by density functional theory implemented in the siesta package. Generally, we observe a good agreement between the calculated and measured phonon pressure coefficients but some particular Raman modes exhibit significant discrepancies similar to the case of wurtzite GaN and ZnO, clearly motivating the presented uniaxial pressure-dependent Raman measurements on bulk AlN crystals.;Anantachaisilp, S., Smith, S.M., Ton-That, C., Osotchan, T., Moon, A.R. & Phillips, M.R. 2014, 'Tailoring deep level surface defects in ZnO nanorods for high sensitivity ammonia gas sensing', Journal of Physical Chemistry C, vol. 118, no. 46, pp. 27150-27156.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;copy;2014 American Chemical Society. The influence of deep level surface defects on electrical and gas sensing properties of ZnO nanorods NH3(g) sensors was studied. ZnO nanorods 50-60 nm in diameter were synthesized via low-temperature hydrothermal growth at 90&&deg;C on sapphire substrates. The as-grown nanorods exhibited a cathodoluminescence (CL) peak centered at 1.90 eV (YL), attributed to LiZn deep acceptors or O interstitials. Subsequent annealing in O2 at 1 atm and Zn vapor at 650&&deg;C produced broad CL peaks centered at 1.70 eV (RL) and 2.44 eV (GL), respectively. The RL and GL have been ascribed to acceptor-like VZn and donor-like VO related centers, respectively. Electrical and gas sensing measurements established that the NH3 gas response sensitivity was 22.6 for O2 anneal (RL), 1.4 for Zn vapor anneal (GL), and 4.1 for the as-grown (YL) samples. Additionally, treatment in H-plasma quenched the RL and inverted the NH3 electrical response due to the incorporation of H donors. Changes in the gas sensing response are explained by a shift in the position of the ZnO Fermi level relative to the chemical potential of NH3 gas due to the creation of near surface donor or acceptors. These data confirm that ZnO nanorods arrays can be tailored to detect specific gas species.

Novel etch kinetics are expected if surface sites are activated during EBIE, and observed experimentally using the electron sensitive material ultra nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD).

The ordering of the valence bands [A(?7), B(?9), C(?7)] is found to be robust even for high uniaxial and biaxial strains. Theoretical results for the uniaxial pressure coefficients and splitting rates of the A, B, and C valence bands and their optical transitions are obtained including the effects of the spin-orbit interaction. The excitonic deformation potentials are derived and the stress rates for hydrostatic pressure are determined based on the results for uniaxial and biaxial stress. In addition, the theory for the stress dependence of the exchange interaction and longitudinal-transversal splitting of the exciton polaritons is developed using the basic exciton functions of the quasicubic approximation and taking the interaction between all exciton states into account. It is shown that the consideration of these effects is crucial for an accurate description of the stress dependence of the optical spectra in ZnO.

These results highlight the potential to modify the local luminescent properties of ZnO by e-beam irradiation. &&copy;2012 Materials Research Society.;Ton-That, C., Weston, L. & Phillips, M.R. 2012, 'Characteristics of point defects in the green luminescence from Zn- and O-rich ZnO', Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, vol. 86, no. 11.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Cathodoluminescence spectra have been measured to determine the characteristics of ubiquitous green luminescence (GL) in nonstoichiometric zinc oxide (ZnO). Zn- and O-rich ZnO were found to exhibit characteristic emissions at 2.53 eV [full width at half-maximum (FWHM) 340 meV] and 2.30 eV (FWHM 450 meV), respectively. Hydrogen was used to probe the physical nature of GL centers. The Zn-rich GL is enhanced upon H incorporation, whereas the O-rich GL is completely quenched as its underlying acceptor-like V Zn centers are passivated by H. The GL emission bands each exhibit remarkably different excitation-power dependencies. The Zn-rich GL follows a close to linear relationship with excitation power, while the O-rich GL exhibits a square-root dependence. Calculations based on bimolecular recombination equations show the defect concentration in Zn-rich ZnO is three orders of magnitude greater than that in O-rich ZnO, indicating V O is more readily formed than V Zn in thermochemical treatments of ZnO. &&copy;2012 American Physical Society.;Bishop, J., Toth, M., Phillips, M. & Lobo, C. 2012, 'Effects of oxygen on electron beam induced deposition of SiO2 using physisorbed and chemisorbed tetraethoxysilane', Applied Physics Letters, vol. 101, no. 21.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Electron beam induced deposition (EBID) is limited by low throughput and purity of as-grown material. Co-injection of O2 with the growth precursor is known to increase both the purity and deposition rate of materials such as SiO2 at room temperature. Here, we show that O2 inhibits rather than enhances EBID from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) precursor at elevated temperatures. This behavior is attributed to surface site competition between chemisorbates at elevated temperature, and TEOS decomposition by atomic oxygen produced through electron dissociation of physisorbed O2 at room temperature. &&copy;2012 American Institute of Physics.;Bishop, J., Lobo, C.J., Martin, A., Ford, M., Phillips, M. & Toth, M. 2012, 'Role of activated chemisorption in gas-mediated electron beam induced deposition', Physical Review Letters, vol. 109, no. 14.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Models of adsorbate dissociation by energetic electrons are generalized to account for activated sticking and chemisorption, and used to simulate the rate kinetics of electron beam induced chemical vapor deposition (EBID).

It is ascribed to carbon volatilization by hydrogen radicals generated by electron dissociation of NH 3 adsorbates. The volatilization process is also effective at preventing the buildup of residual hydrocarbon impurities that often compromise EBIE, EBID and electron imaging.

The CL emission simulation of threading dislocations in GaN demonstrated that a better signal-to-noise ratio was obtained with lower incident electron energy than with higher energy. Second, the capability to simulate the distribution of the deposited energy in 3D was used to determine exposure parameters for polymethylmethacrylate resist using electron-beam lithography (EBL).

For the nanodot synthesis, thin amorphous silicon (a-Si) layers with different thicknesses have been deposited onto the ultrathin (2 nm) oxidized (111) surface of Si wafers by electron beam evaporation under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The solid phase crystallization of the initial layer is induced by a subsequent in situ annealing step at 700&&deg;C, which leads to the dewetting of the initial a-Si layer. This process results in the self-organized formation of highly crystalline Si nanodot islands. Scanning electron microscopy confirms that size, shape, and planar distribution of the nanodots depend on the thickness of the initial a-Si layer. Cross-sectional investigations reveal a single-crystalline structure of the nanodots. This characteristic is observed as long as the thickness of the initial a-Si layer remains under a certain threshold triggering coalescence. The underlying ultra-thin oxide is not structurally affected by the dewetting process. Furthermore, a method for the fabrication of close-packed stacks of nanodots is presented, in which each nanodot is covered by a 2 nm thick SiO 2 shell.

We observe, using transient optical spectroscopy, the processes of charge separation, recombination and sweep-out in efficient polymer-fullerene devices.

The behavior of the vortices, including penetration into and expulsion from the single crystal with increasing and decreasing external fields, respectively, is discussed. The motion behavior is similar to that observed in high-Tc superconducting cuprates with strong vortex pinning, however, the flux-front is irregular due to randomly distributed defects in the crystal. &&copy;2011 American Institute of Physics.;Callsen, G., Reparaz, J.S., Wagner, M.R., Kirste, R., Nenstiel, C., Hoffmann, A. & Phillips, M.R. 2011, 'Phonon deformation potentials in wurtzite GaN and ZnO determined by uniaxial pressure dependent Raman measurements', Applied Physics Letters, vol. 98, no. 6.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;We report the phonon deformation potentials of wurtzite GaN and ZnO for all zone center optical phonon modes determined by Raman measurements as a function of uniaxial pressure.

In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the properties of the deeply bound excitons with particular focus on the Y0 transition at 3.333 eV. The electronic and optical properties of these centers are compared to those of the shallow impurity related exciton binding centers (I lines). In contrast to the shallow donors in ZnO, the deeply bound exciton complexes exhibit a large discrepancy between the thermal activation energy and localization energy of the excitons and cannot be described by an effective mass approach. The different properties between the shallow and deeply bound excitons are also reflected by an exceptionally small coupling of the deep centers to the lattice phonons and a small splitting between their two electron satellite transitions. Based on a multitude of different experimental results including magnetophotoluminescence, magnetoabsorption, excitation spectroscopy (PLE), time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and uniaxial pressure measurements, a qualitative defect model is developed which explains all Y lines as radiative recombinations of excitons bound to extended structural defect complexes. These defect complexes introduce additional donor states in ZnO. Furthermore, the spatially localized character of the defect centers is visualized in contrast to the homogeneous distribution of shallow impurity centers by monochromatic cathodoluminescence imaging. A possible relation between the defect bound excitons and the green luminescence band in ZnO is discussed. The optical properties of the defect transitions are compared to similar luminescence lines related to defect and dislocation bound excitons in other II-VI and III-V semiconductors. &&copy;2011 American Physical Society.;Callsen, G., Reparaz, J.S., Wagner, M.R., Vierck, A., Phillips, M.R., Thomsen, C. & Hoffmann, A. 2011, 'Titanium-assisted growth of silica nanowires: From surface-matched to free-standing morphologies', Nanotechnology, vol. 22, no. 40.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;We report on an oxide-assisted growth technique for silica nanowires which allows tuning the growth from surface-matched nanowires to free-standing morphologies based on growth control by Ti in the role of a catalyst and surfactant. Using an adjustable Ti concentration, we grew silica nanowires with lengths ranging from 100nm up to several millimetres whose defect chemistry was analysed by electron microscopy tools, monochromatic cathodoluminescence imaging and time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. The knowledge of the luminescence properties and the related defect occurrence along with their spatial distribution is pivotal for advancing silica nanowire growth in order to realize successful device designs based on self-assembled Si/SiOx nanostructures. We demonstrate a core-shell structure of the grown nanowires with a highly luminescent 150nm thick shell and outstandingly fast decaying dynamics (?1ns) for glass-like materials. The conjunction of the observed efficient and stable luminescences with their attributed decaying behaviours suggests applications for silica nanowires such as active and passive optical interconnectors and white light phosphors. The identification of a time domain difference for the spectral regime from 2.3 to 3.3eV, within the confined spatial dimensions of a single nanowire, is very promising for future, e.g.data transmission applications, employing silica nanowires which exhibit achievable compatibility with commonly applied silicon-based electronics.

To mimic surface growth temperature variations two glass substrates of differing thickness and thermal conductivity were intentionally used for the same growth conditions. The samples were characterised using optical transmission, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicate that the apparent band-gap shift in polycrystalline narrow band-gap indium nitride thin-films is not primarily determined by the quality of indium nitride crystallites but rather it is associated with growth temperature dependent chemical variations in the films. &&copy;2010 Elsevier B.V.

The green and yellow intensities and their intensity ratios to the NBE vary with excitation depth for both undoped and H-doped ZnO crystals. The intensities of the green and yellow emissions exhibit sublinear dependencies on electron beam excitation density while the NBE intensity increases linearly with the excitation density.

We report on the electrical and structural properties of boron-doped diamond tips commonly used for in-situ electromechanical testing during nanoindentation. The boron dopant environment, as evidenced by cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy, revealed significantly different boron states within each tip. Characteristic emission bands of both electrically activated and nonelectrically activated boron centers were identified in all boron-doped tips. Surface CL mapping also revealed vastly different surface properties, confirming a high amount of nonelectrically activated boron clusters at the tip surface. Raman microspectroscopy analysis showed that structural characteristics at the atomic scale for boron-doped tips also differ significantly when compared to an undoped diamond tip. Furthermore, the active boron concentration, as inferred via the Raman analysis, varied greatly from tip-to-tip. It was found that tips (or tip areas) with low overall boron concentration have a higher number of electrically inactive boron, and thus non-Ohmic contacts were made when these tips contacted metallic substrates. Conversely, tips that have higher boron concentrations and a higher number of electrically active boron centers display Ohmic-like contacts. Our results demonstrate the necessity to understand and fully characterize the boron environments, boron concentrations, and atomic structure of the tips prior to performing in situ electromechanical experiments, particularly if quantitative electrical data are required.;Lockrey, M.N. & Phillips, M.R. 2011, 'Characterisation of the optical properties of InGaN MQW structures using a combined SEM and CL spectral mapping system', Journal of Semiconductors, vol. 32, no. 1.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;We demonstrate the ability of a combined scanning electron microscope and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectral mapping system to provide important spatially resolved information.

However, a detailed quantitative understanding of the electronic properties of transition metal doped semiconductors has often been neglected.

Methods to address these issues are outlined, and a wealth of data on the electronic properties of Fe doped III-V and II-VI compound semiconductors that have been obtained over a few decades is reviewed thoroughly. The review is complemented by new results on the effective-mass-like state consisting of a hole bound to Fe2+ forming a shallow acceptor state. The positions of established Fe3+/2+ and Fe2+/1+ charge transfer levels are summarized and predictions on the positions of further charge transfer levels are made based on the internal reference rule. The Fe3+/4+ level has not been identified unambiguously in any of the studied materials. Detailed term schemes of the observed charge states in tetrahedral and trigonal crystal field symmetry are presented including hyperfine structure, isotope effects and Jahn-Teller effect. Particularly, the radiative transitions Fe3+(4T 1? 1A1) and Fe2+(5E? 5T2) are analyzed in great detail. An effective-mass-like state [Fe2+, h] consisting of a hole bound to Fe2+ is of great significance for a potential realization of spin-coupling in a DMS. New insights on this shallow acceptor state could be obtained by means of stress dependent and temperature dependent absorption experiments in the mK range. The binding energy and effective Bohr radius were determined for GaN, GaP, InP and GaAs and a weak exchange interaction between the hole and the Fe2+ center was detected.

Surface migration of adatoms from higher order facets to (1 0 0) facets results in enhanced deposition rates closer to the edge of the openings and vapour phase diffusion of adatoms results in density variations across the openings over length scales greater than the surface migration length of the adatoms. &&copy;2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.;Zareie, H.M., Morgan, S.W., Moghaddam, M., Maaroof, A.I., Cortie, M.B. & Phillips, M.R. 2008, 'Nanocapacitive circuit elements', ACS Nano, vol. 2, no. 8, pp. 1615-1619.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Natural\" lithography was used to prepare arrays of nanoscale capacitors on silicon.

The results show that the presence of a large surface-to-volume ratio is the determinant to suppress the formation of excitons in ZnO nanobelts. Ab initio calculations show that a drastic decrease of density-of-state in the conduction band and increase in the valence band upon size reduction are the key consequence of the large surface-to-volume ratio, revealing the possible fundamental physical origin of exciton suppression. The weak exciton polarity also reduces the likelihood for an exciton to couple with longitudinal phonons. This causes a reduction in the first longitudinal phonon replica intensity and then a complete suppression of the second replica. Understanding the effect of large surface ratio upon the physical properties of ZnO nanomaterials may provide new insights into the fundamental science of nanotechnology for the development of optoelectronics. &&copy;2008 American Chemical Society.;Ton-That, C., Stockton, G., Phillips, M.R., Nguyen, T.P., Huang, C.H. & Cojocaru, A. 2008, 'Luminescence properties of poly- (phenylene vinylene) derivatives', Polymer International, vol. 57, no. 3, pp. 496-501.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Background: Conjugated polymers, especially those of the poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV) family, are promising candidates as emission material in light-emitting devices. The aim of this work was to investigate the dependence of the luminescence properties of PPV-based derivatives on their polymer structure, especially side groups. Results: Three PPV derivatives, BEHPPV, MEHPPV and MEHSPPV, were synthesised and characterised by photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopies in the temperature range 10-300K. PL and CL spectra of the polymers exhibit similar luminescence peaks, which undergo a blue shift with increasing temperature. The shift in wavelength is accompanied by variations in the relative intensities of emission peaks. Both BEHPPV and MEHPPV display emission characteristics of the PPV backbone, but the peak of MEHPPV shifts to a longer wavelength in comparison with the corresponding peak of BEHPPV at the same temperature. The luminescence spectra of MEHSPPV, which has a sulfanyl incorporated in the side chain, are considerably different from those of the two other derivatives. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the luminescence properties depend strongly on the chain conformations of the conjugated backbone, which are affected by polymer side chains. &&copy;2007 Society of Chemical Industry.;Ton-That, C., Foley, M. & Phillips, M.R. 2008, 'Luminescent properties of ZnO nanowires and as-grown ensembles', Nanotechnology, vol. 19, no. 41.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Vertically aligned ZnO nanowires were synthesized on a sapphire (1120) substrate by vapour deposition and their light-emitting properties were characterized using photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies.

Comparison of the luminescent properties of the as-grown ensemble and the nanowires extracted from it shows that the mosaic film is the major source of the defect-related green emission while the nanowires possess highly crystalline quality with virtually no defects. Photoemission spectroscopy shows that the valence band states associated with O 2p from the as-grown sample are diminished compared with those from the extracted nanowires.

In contrast, the structure of the polymer and its conjugation length are not affected by the presence of ZnO nanoparticles (up to 16 wt% ZnO) as revealed by Raman spectroscopy. The blue shift and photoluminescence quenching are explained by the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the MEH-PPV/ZnO interface and the charging of the nanoparticles.

The introduction of Fe is found to promote the formation of structurally inhomogeneous regions of increased donor concentration. We detect a tendency of these regions to form hexagonal pits at the surface. The locally increased carrier concentration leads to enhanced emission from the band edge and the internal T4 1 (G) - A6 1 (S) transition of Fe3+. In these areas, the luminescence forms a finely structured highly symmetric pattern, which is attributed to defect migration along strain-field lines. Fe doping is found to quench the yellow defect luminescence band and to enhance the blue luminescence band due to the lowering of the Fermi level and the formation of point defects, respectively. &&copy;2008 American Institute of Physics.;Veal, T.D., Piper, L.F.J., Phillips, M.R., Zareie, M.H., Lu, H., Schaff, W.J. & McConville, C.F. 2007, 'Doping-dependence of subband energies in quantized electron accumulation at InN surfaces', Physica Status Solidi (A) Applications and Materials Science, vol. 204, no. 2, pp. 536-542.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Electron tunnelling spectroscopy is used to investigate the quantized electron accumulation at the surfaces of wurtzite InN with different doping levels.

Also observed within the tunnelling spectra are additional features between the conduction band minimum and the pinned Fermi level.

However, EBID fabrication of functional nanostructures is limited by beam spread in bulk substrates, substrate charging, and delocalized film growth around deposits. Here, we overcome these problems by using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) to perform EBID and etching while eliminating charging artifacts at the nanoscale. Nanostructure morphology is tailored by slimming of deposits by ESEM imaging in the presence of a gaseous etch precursor and by pre-etching small features into a deposit (using a stationary or a scanned electron beam) prior to a final imaging process. The utility of this process is demonstrated by slimming of nanowires deposited by EBID, by the fabrication of gaps (between 4 and 7 nm wide) in the wires, and by the removal of thin films surrounding such nanowires. ESEM imaging provides a direct view of the slimming process, yielding process resolution that is limited by ESEM image resolution (~1 nm) and surface roughening occurring during etching. &&copy;2007 American Chemical Society.;Toth, M., Knowles, W.R. & Phillips, M.R. 2007, 'Imaging deep trap distributions by low vacuum scanning electron microscopy', Applied Physics Letters, vol. 90, no. 7.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The distribution of deep traps in a bulk dielectric (Al2 O3) is imaged by low vacuum scanning electron microscopy (LVSEM).

The evidence of nanocrystalline character is also clear in the UV-Vis absorption that shows an excitonic peak at about 236 nm (5.2 eV) arising from band edge transitions. A photoluminescence emission peak centered at about 450 nm (2.7 eV) is attributed to transitions between shallow donors and Zn+ vacancies.

The model of a quantum confined atom was introduced to explain the observed experimental results. It was later claimed that this model is incorrect. Based on the results of our photoluminescence, photoluminescence kinetics, time-resolved photoluminescence, electron spin resonance, and optically detected magnetic resonance investigations, we confirm photoluminescence enhancement and decrease of photoluminescence lifetime and relate these effects to spin dependent magnetic interactions between localized spins of Mn2+ ions and spins/magnetic moments of free carriers.

This paper quantitatively describes gaseous electron-ion recombination (also known as 'signal scavenging') in an environmental scanning electron microscope at a transient level by utilizing the dark shadows/streaks seen in gaseous secondary electron detector images of alumina (Al2O3) immediately after a region of enhanced secondary electron emission is encountered by a scanning electron beam. The investigation firstly derives a theoretical model of gaseous electron-ion recombination that takes into consideration transients caused by the time constant of the gaseous secondary electron detector electronics and external circuitry used to generate images. Experimental data of pixel intensity versus time of the streaks are then simulated using the model enabling the relative magnitudes of (i) ionization and recombination rates, (ii) recombination coefficients and (iii) electron drift velocities, as well as absolute values of the total time constant of the gaseous secondary electron detection system and external circuitry, to be determined as a function of microscope operating parameters such as gaseous secondary electron detector bias, sample-electrode separation, imaging gas pressure, and scan speed. The results revealed, for the first time, the exact dependence that the effects of secondary electron-ion recombination on signal formation has on reduced electric field and time in an environmental scanning electron microscope.

Here a gaseous scintillation detection (GSD) system is developed to efficiently detect photons produced via excitation reactions in electron cascades. Images acquired using GSD are compared to those obtained using conventional gaseous secondary electron detection (GSED) and demonstrate that images rich in secondary electron (SE) contrast can be achieved using the gaseous scintillation signal. A theoretical model, based on existing Townsend theories, is developed. It describes the production and amplification of photon signals generated by cascading SEs, high energy backscattered electrons, and primary beam electrons. Photon amplification (the total number of photons produced per sample emissive electron) is then investigated and compared to conventional electronic amplification over a wide range of microscope operating parameters, scintillating imaging gases, and photon collection geometries. These studies revealed that argon gas exhibited the largest GSD gain, followed by nitrogen then water vapor, exactly opposite to the trend observed for electron amplification data. It was also found that detected scintillation signals exhibit larger SE signal-to-background levels compared to those of conventional electronic signals detected via GSED.

It was found that lithium significantly enhanced the cathodoluminescence signal from the rare-earth ions, which has been attributed to the increased integration of the rare-earth ions into the ZnO structure. The nanophase ZnO products were also annealed in argon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with hydrogen being the most successful for removing the broad defect emission present in as-grown samples and enhancing the ZnO near band edge emission. &&copy;Microscopy Society of America 2006.;White, R., Phillips, M.R., Thomas, P. & Wuhrer, R. 2006, 'In-situ investigation of discolouration processes between historic oil paint pigments', Microchimica Acta, vol. 155, no. 1-2, pp. 319-322.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;Discolouring interactions between paint pigments have been observed since the mid 19th century.

Due to color mixing of band edge and deep defect-related emissions these layers emit intensive white light. Depth profiling cathodoluminescence indicates that green and red emissions mostly come from disordered regions of the films, close to the ZnSe/GaAs interface. We tested a possibility of tuning of chromaticity coordinates and of color temperature of the emission. We found that the chromaticity parameters (color perception) can be tuned by either regulating the appropriate accelerating voltage of electrons or current density of primary electrons in cathodoluminescence investigations.

The intensity of the ZnO near band edge peak was significantly increased after heat treatment in hydrogen. Conversely, thermal annealing in the other gas types decreased this emission. This effect is attributed to hydrogen passivation of competitive non-radiative defect centers, most likely bulk zinc vacancy centers. The appearance of a strong green emission centered at 2.4 eV following thermal annealing in all gas atmospheres is ascribed to the formation of bulk oxygen vacancy defects. A strong red shift of the near band edge emission with increasing beam current at 300 K is accredited to electron beam heating rather than to an increase in the carrier density. Electron beam heating is evidenced by the occurrence of a strong black body emission in the near infrared spectral region. &&copy;2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These results suggest that the acceptor responsible for the 3.27 eV DAP emission in Mg-doped GaN is Mg and that the donor (20-30 meV) is hydrogen-related, possibly a (VN-H) complex. This complex is dissociated either by electron irradiation or thermal annealing in N2 or O2 atmosphere. We found that upon electron irradiation, a deeper emission line (centered at 3.14 eV) emerged, which was assigned to a DAP consisting of the same Mg acceptor level and a deeper donor (100-200 meV) with a similar capture cross section as the donor in the 3.27 eV emission.

Nine different pigments were found on the painting. Many of the identified colors were modern pigments that became available only late in the 19th century as a result of scientific advances in pigment chemistry. Although similar colors were available in a natural mineral form, they lacked the vivid color of their manufactured counterparts. The use of these new synthetic metallic oxide colors by Monet accounts for the brilliance of his paintings.

During intense electron beam irradiation (e.g. Eb, = 10 keV, Ib = 80 nA), an electric field is generated within the primary beam interaction volume. We observed the following two electric field-related effects: (i) an increased electron recombination length and a subsequent field-assisted charge spreading, which causes a dissociation of Mg-H complexes beyond the interaction volume of the primary electron beam, and ii) thermally assisted electro-migration of positively charged, mobile defects leading to the formation of deeper complexes, which are highly stable and act as nonradiative recombination pathways. Furthermore, the diffusion of electron beam-dissociated hydrogen was found to result in the passivation of Mg acceptors beyond the charge recombination volume. &&copy;2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The CL intensity dependence on excitation density was analyzed using a power-law model (ICL? Jm) for each of the observed CL bands in this material. The yellow luminescence band present in both silicon and undoped GaN exhibits a close to cube root (m = 0.33) dependence on electron beam excitation at both 77 K and 300 K. However, the blue (at 300 K) and donor-acceptor pair (at 77 K) emission peaks observed in undoped GaN follow power laws with exponents of m = 1 and m = 0.5, respectively. As expected from its excitonic character, the near band edge emission intensity depends linearly (m = 1) in silicon doped GaN and superlinearly (m = 1.2) in undoped GaN on the electron beam current. Results show that the intensities of the CL bands are highly dependent not only on the defect concentration but also on the electron-hole pair density and injection rate. Furthermore, the size of the focussed electron beam was found to have a considerable effect on the relative intensities of the CL emission peaks. Hence SEM parameters such as the objective lens aperture size, astigmatism, and the condenser lens setting must also be considered when assessing CL data based on intensity measurements from this material.;Gelhausen, O., Klein, H.N., Phillips, M.R. & Goldys, E.M. 2002, 'Influence of low-energy electron beam irradiation on defects in activated Mg-doped GaN', Applied Physics Letters, vol. 81, no. 20, pp. 3747-3749.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS or Publisher's site;The influence of low-energy electron beam irradiation (LEEBI) on residual hydrogen impurities and defects in activated magnesium doped gallium nitride layers was studied.

CL imaging of indents which exhibit plastic deformation (based on indentation data) shows an observable \"footprint\" of deformation-produced defects that result in a strong reduction in the intensity of CL emission. Multiple discontinuities are observed during loading when the maximum load is above the elastic-plastic threshold, and such a behavior can be correlated with multiple slip bands revealed by XTEM. No evidence of pressure-induced phase transformations is found from within the mechanically damaged regions using selected-area diffraction patterns. The main deformation mechanism appears to be the nucleation of slip on the basal planes, with dislocations being nucleated on additional planes on further loading.

This method allows the dose region above the threshold dose for isolation to be conveniently studied, whereas the application of conventional (low-voltage) electrical techniques in this dose range with large sheet resistances of the material (?1011/sq) is often impossible due to comparable parasitic resistances of the experimental setup. A correlation of EDS and resistance measurements of GaN strongly suggests that the magnitude of sample charging scales with the number of ion-beam-produced deep electron traps which are empty at equilibrium.

Experimental data unequivocally shows that C is involved in the defect-impurity complex responsible for YL. In addition, C-related complexes appear to act as efficient nonradiative recombination centers. Implantation of H produces a broad luminescent peak which is slightly blueshifted with respect to the C-related YL band in the case of high excitation densities.

Both contrast mechanisms can provide information on microscopic variations in dielectric properties. We present a model of SE contrast formation that accounts for localized charging and the effects of gas ions on the SE emission process, emitted electrons above the sample surface, and subsurface trapped charge. The model explains the ion flux dependence of charge-induced SE contrast, an increase in the sensitivity to surface contrast observed in SE images of charged dielectrics, and yields procedures for identification of contrast produced by localized sample charging. &&copy;2002 American Institute of Physics. &&copy;2002 American Institute of Physics.;Godlewski, M., Goldys, E.M., Phillips, M., Böttcher, T., Figge, S., Hommel, D., Czernecki, R., Prystawko, P., Leszczynski, M., Perlin, P., Wisniewski, P., Suski, T., Bockowski, M., Grzegory, I. & Porowski, S. 2002, 'Relationship between sample morphology and carrier diffusion length in GaN thin films', Acta Physica Polonica A, vol. 102, no. 4-5, pp. X627-X632.;View/Download from: UTS OPUS;Scanning and spot-mode cathodoluminescence investigations of homo-and hetero-epitaxial GaN films indicate a surprisingly small influence of their microstructure on overall intensity of a light, emission.

This loss results from electron scattering in a gaseous jet formed inside and downstream (above) the pressure-limiting aperture (PLA), which separates the high-pressure and high-vacuum regions of the microscope. The electron beam loss above the PLA has been calculated for three different ESEMs, each with a different PLA geometry: an ElectroScan E3, a Philips XL30 ESEM, and a prototype instrument. The mass thickness of gas above the PLA in each case has been determined by Monte Carlo simulation of the gas density variation in the gas jet. It has been found that the PLA configurations used in the commercial instruments produce considerable loss in the electron probe current that dramatically degrades their performance at high chamber pressure and low accelerating voltage.

In contrast to photoluminescence measurements, CL studies of GaN are usually performed in a regime with a strongly nonlinear dependence of luminescence intensities on excitation due to a large difference in carrier generation rates for these two techniques. As a result, the ratios of near-gap to YL and DAP emission intensities strongly depend on electron-beam current.

Slip is identified as one of the physical mechanisms responsible for plastic deformation of GaN and may also contribute to the \"pop-in\" events observed during loading. No visible material cracking is found even after indentations at high loads (900 mN), but a pronounced elevation of the material surrounding the impression is observed. &&copy;2000 American Institute of Physics.;Toth, M. & Phillips, M.R. 2000, 'The role of induced contrast in images obtained using the environmental scanning electron microscope', Scanning, vol. 22, no. 6, pp. 370-379.;Generation of contrast in images obtained using the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) is explained by interpretation of images acquired using the gaseous secondary electron detector (GSED), ion current, and the Everhart-Thornley detector. We present a previously unreported contrast component in GSED and ion current images attributed to signal induction by changes in the concentration of positive ions in the ESEM chamber during image acquisition. Changes in positive ion concentration are caused by changes in electron emission from the sample during image acquisition and by a discrepancy between the drift velocities of negative and positive charge carriers in the imaging gas. The proposed signal generation mechanism is used to explain contrast reversal in images produced using the GSED and ion current signals and accounts for discrepancies in contrast observed, under some conditions, in these types of images. Combined with existing models of signal generation in the ESEM, the proposed model provides a basis for correct interpretation of ESEM images.;Phillips, M.R. & Ott, D.M. 2000, 'Crosstalk caused by nonideal output filters in WDM lightwave systems', IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS, vol. 12, no. 8, pp. 1094-1096.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Toth, M. & Phillips, M. 2000, 'Space Charge Artefacts in ESEM Images: Shadowing and Contrast', Microscopy & Microanalysis, vol. 6, no. 2, pp. 775-775.;Godlewski, M., Goldys, E.M., Phillips, M.R., Langer, R. & Barski, A. 2000, 'Cathodoluminescence depth-profiling studies of GaN/AlGaN quantum-well structures', Journal of Materials Research, vol. 15, no. 2, pp. 495-501.;In this paper we evaluate the in-depth homogeneity of GaN epilayers and the influence of electric field present in strained GaN/AlGaN heterostructures and quantum wells on the yellow and \"edge\" emission in GaN and AlGaN. Our depth-profiling cathodoluminescence measurements show an increased accumulation of defects at the interface. Inhomogeneities in the doping level are reflected by the enhancement of the yellow emission in the interface region. The piezoelectric effect is found to strongly reduce the emission from the strained AlGaN quantum-well barriers. We also show that Ga droplets, commonly found on surfaces of samples grown in Ga-rich conditions, screen the internal electric field in a structure and thus result in a local enhancement of the edge emission intensity.;Toth, M. & Phillips, M.R. 1999, 'Detection of Cr impurities in GaN by room temperature cathodoluminescence spectroscopy', Applied Physics Letters, vol. 75, no. 25, pp. 3983-3985.;Trace levels of Cr impurities in epitaxial GaN grown on sapphire substrates were investigated using cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy.

Microanalysis of coatings was conducted with microprobe Raman and scanning cathodoluminescence microscopy. It was confirmed that the darker regions in polished cross sections represent the amorphous phase. The more intense cathodoluminescence emission from the amorphous phase during electron-beam irradiation compared with the crystalline phase was used to detect the two structurally different areas within the sample. By selecting the peak of the emission at 450 nm it was possible to raster the surface with the electron beam and produce a map of the amorphous phase in polished sections, a fracture surface and an as-sprayed surface of the plasma-sprayed coating.

Impurities are strongly correlated with the grain structure of the precious opal and a higher than average concentration of impurity defects are observed at grain boundaries and cracks.

A range of Ti/Al/N compositions were produced by varying the aluminium target magnetron current. The thin films were then examined using an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a field emission scanning electron microscope. Aluminium, titanium and nitrogen compositions (wt.%) were determined by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It was found that as the aluminium magnetron current increased from 0.1 to 0.4 A, the titanium decreased from 77 wt.% to 53 wt.%, the aluminium increased from 6 wt.% to 25 wt.% and the colour changed from gold to a blue-grey. An increase in the aluminium content had a significant effect on the grain size of the film. Surface measurement analysis using the AFM results revealed that as the aluminium content increased both the rms roughness (6.5 nm? 3.2 nm) and grain size (120 nm? 90 nm) decreased. It is believed that the above effects could result from the increase in aluminium atom bombardment rate with the higher aluminium magnetron current.;Stevens Kalceff, M.A., Phillips, M.R. & Moon, A.R. 1996, 'Electron irradiation-induced changes in the surface topography of silicon dioxide', Journal of Applied Physics, vol. 80, no. 8, pp. 4308-4314.;The irradiation of crystalline (?-SiO2) and amorphous (?-SiO2) silicon dioxide with a stationary electron beam produces characteristic changes in the surface topography. The development of these changes has been investigated using cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and microscopy, scanning probe (atomic force) microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Electron irradiation produces a permanent volume increase on (crystalline)?-SiO2, while in (amorphous)?-SiO2 an initial small volume increase is followed by volume loss as irradiation continues. The observed changes are consistent with electromigration of oxygen under the influence of the electric field induced by charge trapping at preexisting or irradiation-induced defects. Oxygen enrichment may produce expansion of the surface region due to the formation of peroxy linkage defects. In?-SiO2, charges trapped by defects at grain boundaries produce enhanced electric fields which may result in volume reduction at the surface, when critical field strengths are exceeded. The observed volume reductions may be attributed to electron stimulated desorption of constituents, in particular oxygen mass loss, and densification of the surface region associated with the formation of oxygen-deficient defect centers. &&copy;1996 American Institute of Physics.;Ariyavisitakul, S., Darcie, T.E., Greenstein, L.J., Phillips, M.R. & Shankaranarayanan, N.K. 1996, 'Performance of simulcast wireless techniques for personal communication systems', IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS, vol. 14, no. 4, pp. 632-643.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Kim, Y., Yuan, S., Leon, R., Jagadish, C., Gal, M., Johnston, M.B., Phillips, M.R., Stevens Kalceff, M.A., Zou, J. & Cockayne, D.J.H. 1996, 'Effects of anodic oxide induced intermixing on the structural and optical properties of quantum wire structure grown on nonplanar GaAs substrate', Journal of Applied Physics, vol. 80, no. 9, pp. 5014-5020.;Effects of anodic oxide induced intermixing on the structural and optical properties of stacked GaAs quantum wire (QWR) structures grown on a sawtooth-type nonplanar GaAs substrate are investigated.

Intermixing was achieved by pulsed anodic oxidation of the GaAs cap layer and subsequent rapid thermal annealing, was verified by XTEM analysis. A significant enhancement of QWR PL is observed accompanied by a notable blueshift of the sidewall quantum well (SQWL) PL due to the intermixing.

It is proposed that the accumulated oxygen is incorporated into the quartz surface structure as peroxy linkages, the formation of which results in the permanent volume increase observed as amorphous outgrowths on crystalline quartz.

Electron diffraction analysis established the following precipitate/host orientation relationships: tetragonal TiO2: {011}r{norm of matrix} {11 {Mathematical expression}07B,100}r{norm of matrix}(0001)s and?01 {Mathematical expression}?r?10 {Mathematical expression}0?s twinned along the (011)r planeand orthorhombic TiO2: {021}?{norm of matrix}{11 {Mathematical expression}0}s, {100}?{norm of matrix}(0001)s and?0 {Mathematical expression}2??{norm of matrix}?10 {Mathematical expression}0?s twinned along the (021)? plane. &&copy;1991 Springer-Verlag.;MOON, A.R. & PHILLIPS, M.R. 1991, 'ACCURATE OH BOND ANGLE DETERMINATION IN TRIGONAL CRYSTALS', APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY, vol. 45, no. 6, pp. 1051-1053.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;PHILLIPS, M.R., DARCIE, T.E., MARCUSE, D., BODEEP, G.E. & FRIGO, N.J. 1991, 'NONLINEAR DISTORTION GENERATED BY DISPERSIVE TRANSMISSION OF CHIRPED INTENSITY-MODULATED SIGNALS', IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS, vol. 3, no. 5, pp. 481-483.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;McCredie, G.M., Phillips, M.R. & Moon, A.R. 1991, 'Optimization of thinning rates in an argon ion beam thinner', Review of Scientific Instruments, vol. 62, no. 7, pp. 1855-1856.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;A simple and inexpensive ''feedback'' circuit has been devised that regulates the gas flow in an argon ion gun system and thus optimizes the specimen thinning rate.

This produced a set of sharp bands in the i.r. spectrum with stretching frequencies around 3300 cm-1, characteristic of OH bands. The thermal behaviour of these bands was investigated in a series of isochronal and isothermal heating experiments, monitored using FTIR spectroscopy. The i.r. spectra consisted of three main absorption bands at 3309cm-1, 3232cm-1 and 3187cm-1. The i.r. band at 3309cm-1 has been assigned to a (Ti. AlV'''AlOH. oTi. Al)x defect cluster. The lower energy bands at 3232cm-1 and 3187cm-1 were assigned to two structural variants of a (Ti. AlV'''AlOH. o)' defect cluster. The (Ti. AlV'''AlOH. oTi. Al)x defect cluster forms via the following reversible internal diffusion-limited association reaction Ti. Al + (Ti. AlV'''AlOH. o)'? (Ti. AlV'''AlOH. o)x. The binding enthalpy for this reaction was determined to be 1.06 &&plusmn;0.20 eV. The clustering reaction was observed to follow first order reaction kinetics. An activation energy of 2.5 &&plusmn;0.1 eV was determined for the (Ti. AlV'''AlOH. o)' cluster. The relative concentration of all charged and neutral defect associates was found to critically depend on the thermal history of the crystal. The defect structure of Ti4+:?-Al2O3 is also discussed with reference to this study. &&copy;1991.;MOON, A.R. & PHILLIPS, M.R. 1991, 'IRON AND SPINEL PRECIPITATION IN IRON-DOPED SAPPHIRE', JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY, vol. 74, no. 4, pp. 865-868.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Moon, A.R., Phillips, M.R. & Blair, D.G. 1990, 'Equilibration in defect clustering reactions', Solid State Communications, vol. 76, no. 7, pp. 881-882.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;A technique is presented for calculating the optimum cooling profile of a sample to ensure that a given defect cluster concentration is obtained in the shortest possible time. &&copy;1990.;Moon, A.R. & Phillips, M.R. 1984, 'An electron microscopy study of exsolved phases in natural black Australian sapphire', Micron And Microscopica Acta, vol. 15, no. 3, pp. 143-146.;View/Download from: Publisher's site;Natural Australian sapphire (?-Al2O3 with around 1% Fe and up to 0.03% Ti) occurs in many colours, generally with an abundance of exsolved phases. Such 'silky' stones, cut en cabochon, exhibit the well-known phenomenon of asterism. For stones with a well-defined 'star' needle-like precipitate phases can be seen under an optical microscope. The needle axes are perpendicular to the star axes and generally parallel to the prism a-axes. (For artificial star sapphire the precipitate needle axes are perpendicular to the prism axes, e.g. Phillips et al., 1980.) Many authors have assumed that these precipitate phases in natural sapphire were needles of rutile (TiO2) only, as is the case for artificial sapphire (Phillips et al., 1980). Our studies on natural Australian black sapphire, however, confirm the existence of a variety of iron/titanium rich phases, as well as rutile. Sample specimens were prepared by illuminating a polished basal plane with a He-Ne laser to obtain the star directions and then cutting slices of the stone parallel to the star axes. The polished sections were then ion-beam thinned and examined in a JEOL 100CX (S)TEM, equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Precipitate phases were identified by electron diffraction and from their X-ray spectrum. &&copy;1984.;Moon, A.R. & Phillips, M.R. 1984, 'The physics of asterism in sapphire.', Schweizerische Mineralogische und Petrographische Mitteilungen, vol. 64, no. 3, pp. 329-334.;The star image in silky sapphire (asterism) is shown to result from the incoherent superposition of reflected Fraunhofer diffraction patterns. These arise when light is scattered from precipitates strictly oriented within the sapphire host. The theory explains why long, thin precipitates produce sharper stars than their shorter and wider counterparts and why a cabochon is normally required to observe the star image. -W.S.;Selected Peer-Assessed Projects;Development of Low Cost, High Quality Nitrides for Solid-State Lighting and Other Power Saving Applications;Optimisation of the electrical and optical properties of ZnO nanowires for advanced nanodevice applications;Development of direct-write focussed electron beam processing techniques for nano-fabrication applications;Development of a light detection system for enhanced scanning electron microscopy imaging of fully hydrated biological specimens at room temperature.;Development of growth strategies to fabricate wide band gap ferromagnetic semiconductors for spin electronics applications;Nanoparticle fluorescent labels as a platform for high throughput data gathering;Co-doping and transition metal doping of Gallium Nitride;Development of methodology to determine oxygen and hydrogen content in GaN and its;application to problems of doping and compensation.;FEI Sponsored Chair in Materials Physics;Advanced Optical Characterisation of Nanostructures in White Light Emitting Diodes;Pages;1;2;next ›;last »;about uts;The University;Facilities and maps;UTS governance;Faculties;Privacy statement;Disclaimer",
